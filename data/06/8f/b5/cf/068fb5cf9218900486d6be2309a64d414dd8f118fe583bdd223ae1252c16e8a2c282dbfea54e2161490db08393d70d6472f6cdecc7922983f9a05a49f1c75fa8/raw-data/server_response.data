                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. OVERVIEW

    After installing bos.rte.security 6.1.6.4 fileset, an LDAP user will be
    able to log in with an incorrect password. This occurs only when authtype
    is set to ldap_auth in the /etc/security/ldap/ldap.cfg file. Non-LDAP
    users can also log in with incorrect passwords if the local users have
    their SYSTEM attribute in the /etc/security/user file is set to SYSTEM =
    "LDAP", or the default stanza is set to SYSTEM = "LDAP" and local users do
    not have SYSTEM set in their own stanza. If local users don't have LDAP in
    their SYSTEM attribute, then they will not be affected.

II. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

    To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following
    command:

    lslpp -L bos.rte.security

    The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

    AIX Fileset           Lower Level       Upper Level
    ---------------------------------------------------
    bos.rte.security      6.1.6.4           6.1.6.4

III. SOLUTIONS

    A. APARS

        IBM has assigned the following APARs to this problem:

        AIX Level           APAR number        Availability
        ----------------------------------------------------
        6.1.6               IZ97416            TBD

        Subscribe to the APARs here:

        http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ97416

        By subscribing, you will receive periodic email alerting you
        to the status of the APAR, and a link to download the fix once
        it becomes available.

    B. FIXES

        Fixes are now available.  The fixes can be downloaded from:

        http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/ldapauth_fix.tar
        ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/ldapauth_fix.tar

        The links above are to a tar file containing this signed
        advisory, fix packages, and PGP signatures for each package.
        The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will
        enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX
        Technology Levels.

        AIX Level         Fix
        ----------------------------------------------------
        6.1.6             IZ97416s04.110329.epkg.Z

        To extract the fixes from the tar file:

        tar xvf ldapauth_fix.tar
        cd ldapauth_fix

        Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

        The checksums below were generated using the "sum", "cksum",
        "csum -h MD5" (md5sum), and "csum -h SHA1" (sha1sum) commands
        and are as follows:

        sum         filename
        ------------------------------------
        35429   100 IZ97416s04.110329.epkg.Z

        cksum           filename
        -------------------------------------------
        3033455980 102107 IZ97416s04.110329.epkg.Z

        csum -h MD5 (md5sum)              filename
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        19762b32584c2ed966c0392c34318159  IZ97416s04.110329.epkg.Z


        csum -h SHA1 (sha1sum)                    filename
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        1340021a3b4d47bdeafb96165ecc1cbad9a35ddd  IZ97416s04.110329.epkg.Z

        To verify the sums, use the text of this advisory as input to
        csum, md5sum, or sha1sum. For example:

        csum -h SHA1 -i Advisory.asc
        md5sum -c Advisory.asc
        sha1sum -c Advisory.asc

        These sums should match exactly. The PGP signatures in the tar
        file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the
        integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be
        confirmed, contact IBM AIX Security and describe the
        discrepancy at the following address:

            security-alert@austin.ibm.com

     C. INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION

        IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
        of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
        readable before proceeding.

        Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression
        testing but not the full regression testing that takes place
        for Service Packs; thus, IBM does not warrant the fully
        correct functionality of an interim fix.

        Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

        http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html

        To preview an interim fix installation:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -p         # where ipkg_name is the name of the  
                                     # interim fix package being previewed.

        To install an interim fix package:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -X         # where ipkg_name is the name of the  
                                     # interim fix package being installed.


IV. WORKAROUNDS

    None.
