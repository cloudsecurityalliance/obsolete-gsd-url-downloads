<p>About two and a half years ago I wrote a Rust library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/failure"><code>failure</code></a>, which quickly became one of
the most popular error handling libraries in Rust. This week, its current maintainer decided to
deprecate it, a decision I strongly support. This week, I also released a new and very different
error-handling library, called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/fehler"><code>fehler</code></a>. I wanted to discuss these two libraries briefly.</p>

<h1 id="a-brief-history-of-failure">A brief history of failure</h1>

<p>When I released failure, the most popular error handling library by far was <a href="https://crates.io/crates/error-chain"><code>error-chain</code></a>.
The only other major error handling library at the time really was a library called
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/quick-error"><code>quick-error</code></a>. Both of these libraries had the same basic API: using a macro_rules
macro, the user could enumerate all of the different kinds of errors that occur in their program to
create a big error enum.</p>

<p>For me, the syntax of error-chain was quite confusing, and I found it verbose and overly complex for
the kinds of code I was writing. My experience was that at the application level, most users are not
using errors in a way in which they frequently need to match on them and handle each case
differently. Instead, my experience was that most applications followed a common pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fallible code is very common, but errors are not (that is, the code that returns <code>Result</code> may be
in your hot path, but the <code>Error</code> branch will not be)</li>
<li>Many different kinds of errors can occur during program execution, all of them are handled in the
same way</li>
<li>The way that they are handled is completely agnostic to the kind error, usually some kind of
reporting mechanism is involved, perhaps some sort of backpressure (in network applications).</li>
</ul>

<p>The central idea of <code>failure</code> then was to use a trait object to model the error type, instead of
enum. I&rsquo;m not the person who came up with this: it was how the <code>Error</code> trait in std was always
intended to be used. All I did was investigate why people weren&rsquo;t already using the Error trait in
its intended way. I came up with these conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li>People often want their errors to contain backtraces, because they may need to debug the condition
if it represents a programmer mistake.</li>
<li>The <code>Error::description</code> method had almost no utility.</li>
<li>People often need their errors to be Send, Sync, and &lsquo;static.</li>
<li>People sometimes do need to examine the specific error type, which requires downcasting, which
also requires <code>'static</code>. The <code>Error::cause</code> method, for example, returns an object which cannot be
downcast because it isn&rsquo;t bound by <code>'static</code>.</li>
<li>No one feels good writing <code>-&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error + Send + Sync + 'static&gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thus was born the <code>Fail</code> trait, a &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; Error trait. At the same time, failure provided an
<code>Error</code> type which was essentially a <code>Box&lt;dyn Fail&gt;</code> with some special features. A quick and easy
derive for <code>Fail</code> was provided to avoid the complex macro syntax of earlier libraries. Adoption was
widespread and rapid.</p>

<h2 id="failure-s-fatal-flaw">Failure&rsquo;s fatal flaw</h2>

<p>The big problem with failure was that it required that everyone buy into a new error trait,
<code>failure::Fail</code>. This created compatibility hazards with people who weren&rsquo;t using failure, resulting
in various frustrating experiences. When I wrote failure, I expected a &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; error trait to be
added to std somewhere, that would be identical to failure, so that failure could ultimately just
re-export that trait as <code>failure::Fail</code>.</p>

<p>However, in the long run, things turned out differently. In the end, I made changes to the <code>Error</code>
trait itself, as described in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2504-fix-error.md">RFC 2504</a>. This meant there was no story for making failure
compatible with the std ecosystem.</p>

<p>In the end, many more error libraries have arisen since failure. <a href="https://crates.io/crates/snafu">snafu</a> for example is a bit
of a spiritual successor to error-chain, but using proc macros. The crate I would recommend to
anyone who likes failure&rsquo;s API is <a href="https://crates.io/crates/anyhow">anyhow</a>, which basically provides the <code>failure::Error</code>
type (a fancy trait object), but based on the std <code>Error</code> trait instead of on.</p>

<p>In general, for most libraries I would recommend just manually creating error types and implementing
the Error trait for them. If this is too complicated, consider why your API is throwing so many
different kinds of errors, and whether your library is doing too many things.</p>

<p>For applications, I recommend using a trait object, rather than an enum, to manage your many kinds
of errors. I believe that usually trying to enumerate all of the errors every library you use can
throw is more trouble than its worth, and I still assert that for most applications this will lead
to higher performance by keeping the happy path less pessimized. I recommend <code>anyhow::Error</code> as a
strictly better trait object than <code>Box&lt;dyn Error + Send + Sync + 'static&gt;</code>, not to mention one that
is much easier to deal with.</p>

<h2 id="but-about-fehler">But about Fehler</h2>

<p>When I wrote failure, I also had a vision for syntactic changes to Rust that would make error
handling more lightweight. What I like about the <code>Result</code> type in Rust is that any function which
can raise an error must be annotated as such, at both the definition side <em>and</em> the call site. This
is a great feature, that I would never want to lose, because it allows users to identify all points
of early return in their functions (i.e. marking fallible function calls with <code>?</code> is an amazing
feature).</p>

<p>What I don&rsquo;t like about Rust&rsquo;s error handling story is the impact writing a fallible function has on
all of the unfallible return paths. I do not find that I benefit from writing loads of boilerplate
<code>Ok()</code> expressions. I would prefer a syntax in which I could treat functions as existing only in the
happy path <em>until I need to inspect their fallibility</em>.</p>

<p>This viewpoint is very controversial, and I have no capacity to debate it with anyone who disagrees
with me. But Rust has a very powerful macro system, so I don&rsquo;t have to.</p>

<p>Fehler is a library which provides two macros: an attribute called <code>#[throws]</code> and an expression
macro called <code>throw!()</code>. In functions annotated with <code>throws</code>, all returns are on the &ldquo;Ok&rdquo; happy
path:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">#[throws(io::Error)]
fn read_to_string(path: &amp;impl AsRef&lt;Path&gt;) -&gt; String {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?:
    let mut string = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&amp;mut string)?;
    string // Ok wrapping not necessary
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you do want to raise an error in this context, you can, using the <code>throw</code> macro:</p>

<pre><code class="language-rust">#[throws(io::Error)]
fn read_to_string(path: &amp;impl AsRef&lt;Path&gt;) -&gt; String {
    let mut file = File::open(path)?:
    let mut string = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&amp;mut string)?;

    if string.len() == 0 {
        throw!(io::Error::new(io::ErrorKind::Other, &quot;empty file&quot;));
    }

    string
}
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax also supports functions that return Option and some other features, if you want to know
more you can <a href="https://docs.rs/fehler/1.0.0/fehler/">read the docs</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Fehler in a personal project for the last two months, and I love it. My only issue
with it has been some bad error messages on parse errors that aren&rsquo;t processed well because it&rsquo;s a
proc macro. I am as convinced as I ever have been that this would be a great addition to Rust. I
would encourage anyone else who would like to try writing Rust with syntax like this to use this
library and get a feel for how it works. So much of the discussion around error-handling in Rust has
been deeply ideological and ungrounded in specific experience: this library provides a way to get an
understanding beyond that.</p>

<p>Besides, I have no interest in pushing any further improvement to Rust&rsquo;s error handling syntax,
because of what an enormous drain every attempt to improve that feature has ever been. So I&rsquo;m very
happy to have fehler, which I will keep using in all of my projects, without having to convince
anyone else that it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>
