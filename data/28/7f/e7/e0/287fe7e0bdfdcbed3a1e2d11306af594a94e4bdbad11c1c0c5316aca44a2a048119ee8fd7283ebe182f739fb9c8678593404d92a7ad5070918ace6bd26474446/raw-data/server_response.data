<b>Security   and  Trust  in  Open  Source  Security  Tokens</b><p />
<i>Marc  Schink   and  Alexander  Wagner   and  Florian  Unterstein   and  Johann  Heyszl</i><p />
<b>Abstract: </b>Using  passwords  for  authentication  has  been  proven  vulnerable  in  countless  security  incidents.  Hardware  authentication  tokens  effectively  prevent  most  password-related  security  issues   and  improve  security  indisputably.  However,  we  would  like  to  highlight  that  there  are  new  threats  from  attackers  with  physical  access  which  need  to  be  discussed.  Supply  chain  adversaries  may  manipulate  devices  on  a  large  scale   and  install  backdoors  before  they  even  reach  end  users.  In  evil  maid  scenarios,  specific  devices  may  even  be  attacked  while  already  in  use.  Hence,  we  thoroughly  investigate  the  security   and  trustworthiness  of  eight  commercially  available  open  source  authentication  tokens,  including  devices  from  the  two  market  leaders:  SoloKeys   and  Nitrokey.  Unfortunately,  we  identify   and  practically  verify  significant  vulnerabilities  in  all  eight  examined  tokens.  Some  of  them  based  on  severe,  previously  undiscovered,  vulnerabilities  of  three  major  microcontroller  products  which  are  used  at  a  large  scale  in  various  products.  Our  findings  clearly  emphasize  the  significant  threat  from  supply  chain   and  evil  maid  scenarios  since  the  attacks  are  practical   and  only  require  moderate  attacker  efforts.  Fortunately,  we  are  able  to  describe  software-based  countermeasures  as  effective  improvements  to  retrofit  the  examined  devices.  To  improve  the  security   and  trustworthiness  of  future  authentication  tokens,  we  also  derive  important  general  design  recommendations.
