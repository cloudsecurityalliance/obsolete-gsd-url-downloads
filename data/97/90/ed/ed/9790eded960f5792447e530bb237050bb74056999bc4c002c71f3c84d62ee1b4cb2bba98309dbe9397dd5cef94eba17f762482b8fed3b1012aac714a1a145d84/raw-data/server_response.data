<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-wordpad-and-office-text-converters-could-allow-remote-code-execution-960477">Vulnerabilities in WordPad and Office Text Converters Could Allow Remote Code Execution (960477)</h2>
<p>Published: April 14, 2009 | Updated: June 17, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.3</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities and two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft WordPad and Microsoft Office text converters. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a specially crafted file is opened in WordPad or Microsoft Office Word. Do not open Microsoft Office, RTF, Write, or WordPerfect files from untrusted sources using affected versions of WordPad or Microsoft Office Word.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Office Word 2000. This security update is also rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Office Word 2002; Microsoft Office Converter Pack; and WordPad on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>This security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office Word and Office text converters handle opening specially crafted Word 6.0, Windows Write, and WordPerfect documents. This security update also addresses the vulnerabilities by implementing fixes to WordPad and by preventing WordPad on affected platforms from opening Word 6.0 and Windows Write files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p>This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/960906" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 960906</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>

<h2 id="wordpad-and-office-text-converter-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-0087">WordPad and Office Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0087</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that text converters in WordPad and Microsoft Office process memory when a user opens a specially crafted Word 6 file that includes malformed data.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0087" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-0087</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-wordpad-and-office-text-converter-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-0087">Mitigating Factors for WordPad and Office Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0087</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.</li>
<li>The vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.</li>
<li>All supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 are at a reduced risk to this vulnerability because the affected component is disabled by default. These operating systems are only vulnerable if an administrator has manually enabled the affected component. All supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 do not contain the affected component and are also unaffected.
Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 systems are more at risk because the converter is still active in a default installation. However, on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4 systems that have applied the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=36667" data-linktype="external">MS04-041</a> update, the Word for Windows 6.0 converter will be disabled by default.</li>
<li>Users who have installed and are using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f" data-linktype="external">Office Document Open Confirmation Tool</a> for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancelbefore opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-wordpad-and-office-text-converter-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-0087">Workarounds for WordPad and Office Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0087</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources with affected versions of WordPad or Microsoft Office.</strong></p>
<p>Do not open Office, RTF or Write files from untrusted sources using any software listed as affected in this bulletin on systems that are not updated with the security updates that accompany this bulletin. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.</p>
<p>This includes files that have .wri, .rtf, and .doc file associations. WordPad and Office could also be used to manually open documents. This includes all files that have .wri, .rtf, and .doc file extensions as well files with other extensions. Be aware that WordPad could also be used to open specially crafted documents regardless of the file name extension.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Disable the Word 6 converter by restricting access</strong></p>
<p>An administrator can apply an access control list to affected converters to ensure that the converter is no longer loaded by WordPad and Office. This effectively prevents exploitation of the issue using this attack vector.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> Undo this workaround before installing this security update.</p>
<p>In order to apply the access list, run the following commands from the command prompt. Note that some of these may result in an error message, this is expected.</p>
<p><code>echo y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd6.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.cnv&quot; /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.cnv&quot; /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd664.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:Necho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd6.wpc&quot; /E /P everyone:N</code></p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> Upon implementing the workaround, the user will no longer be able to convert Word 6 documents to WordPad RTF or Word 2003 documents. Microsoft Office Word will return an error saying, &quot;The file appears to be corrupted.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong></p>
<p><code>echo y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd6.wpc&quot; /E /R everyoneecho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.wpc&quot; /E /R everyoneecho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.cnv&quot; /E /R everyoneecho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.wpc&quot; /E /R everyoneecho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\TextConv\mswrd632.cnv&quot; /E /R everyoneecho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd664.wpc&quot; /E /R everyoneecho y| cacls &quot;%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Windows NT\Accessories\mswrd6.wpc&quot; /E /R everyone</code></p>

<h4 id="faq-for-wordpad-and-office-text-converter-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-0087">FAQ for WordPad and Office Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0087</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
A vulnerability exists in WordPad and Office text converters that allows an attacker to execute remote code when a user opens a specially crafted attacker-supplied document. The specific vulnerability exists in the way that the Word 6 converter parses the specially crafted document.</p>
<p><strong>What are WordPad Text Converters and Office Text Converters?</strong><br/>
WordPad is a default component of Microsoft Windows operating systems. Text converters in WordPad allow users who do not have Microsoft Office Word installed to open documents in Microsoft Windows Write (.wri) and Microsoft Office Word 6.0, Microsoft Office Word 97, Microsoft Office Word 2000, and Microsoft Office Word 2002 (.doc) file formats. These text converters also allow users to save documents in the Word 6.0 file format.</p>
<p>Text converters are also a default component of Microsoft Office that allow users to open and save as older Office file formats, including the Word 6.0 file format.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted document with an affected version of WordPad or Microsoft Office Word.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file using either WordPad or Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a document that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.</p>
<p><strong>How are supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 affected by this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The Word for Windows 6.0 converter is not enabled by default on systems running supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

<p><strong>Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit</strong></p>
<p>Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the <a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true" data-linktype="external">Update Compatibility Evaluator</a> components included with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0</a>.</p>
<p>The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).
  
For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
After you install the update, you cannot remove it. To revert to an installation before the update was installed; you must remove the application, and then install it again from the original media.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**  
     Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Office, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
