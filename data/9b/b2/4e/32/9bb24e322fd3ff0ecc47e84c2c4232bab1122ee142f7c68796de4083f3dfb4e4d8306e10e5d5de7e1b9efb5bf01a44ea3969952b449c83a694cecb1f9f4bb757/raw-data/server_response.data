                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION

    CVE-2008-1483:
    OpenSSH 4.3p2, and probably other versions, allows local users to
    hijack forwarded X connections by causing ssh to set DISPLAY to
    :10, even when another process is listening on the associated
    port, as demonstrated by opening TCP port 6010 (IPv4) and sniffing
    a cookie sent by Emacs.

    CVE-2008-1657:
    OpenSSH before 4.9 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the
    sshd_config ForceCommand directive by modifying the .ssh/rc
    session file.
