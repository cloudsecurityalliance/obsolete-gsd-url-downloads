<h2 class="pagetitle">ChangeLog for FileChucker</h2>

<p class="changelog_update_link">(Get <a href="/updates/">the latest version</a>!)</p>














<p>v5.11 (20190415):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Bugfix: fix the <a href="/left_brace_error">unescaped left brace error from Perl</a>.
</li>

</ul>














<p>v5.10 (20170525):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Big performance boost on all the database-viewer pages: these pages often need 
to look up column types, which has to be done many times on pages with lots of
items/files.&nbsp; FileChucker now caches those column types so they only need
to be queried once.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: uploads would sometimes fail due to a check in the email_domain_is_allowed
feature that shouldn't have been occurring.
</li>


<li>
New $PREF{filefield_size} setting, so you can adjust that without having to
edit the big $PREF{filefield_template} setting.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v5.09 (20170127):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Smooth new styling on the admin pages, database viewers, upload log, etc.
</li>


<li>
New folder-owner feature, where you can configure a special email address field
on the upload form, and the entered address will become the "owner" of that
folder, who can then receive notification emails whenever files are uploaded
into it.&nbsp; (Similar to the existing feature for UserBase folder owners, but
this doesn't require UserBase.)
</li>


<li>
New _allowed_domains feature for email fields, so you can restrict who can
upload files based on whether their email address is within a list of allowed
domains (e.g. your company domain).
</li>


<li>
Performance boost: we now skip our database-table-checks on most executions,
only running them once a day, and if/when the app's version number changes 
(e.g. because you just installed an update).
</li>


<li>
New enable_altmode_prefs feature, allowing you to create groups of prefs to
enable/disable the various features, and then switch between them by passing
a URL variable.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v5.08 (20160711):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Security fix: tighten the security on our session cookie by preventing it from
being set via Javascript.
</li>


<li>
Improved and clarified the text and the module-detection stuff on the email-test
page and the check-Perl-modules page.
</li>


<li>
New setting "require_encrypted_connection_for_login_cookie", for improved security
on sites that have SSL enabled.
</li>


<li>
The WebConfig file can now be downloaded via a link on the WebConfig page, to 
make it super easy to back it up.
</li>


<li>
Changed output encoding from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8, in the few places where it 
was still ISO-8859-1.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: if WebConfig was used to adjust a pref containing another %PREF{foo}
variable, that variable was not properly interpolated (e.g. $PREF{css} would
break if edited via WebConfig).
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: if WebConfig was used to adjust a pref containing a textarea (e.g. one
of the template prefs), that pref's value would get screwed up.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: removed all the not-SQL-safe functions and related prefs, which didn't
always handle non-English characters properly, and had various other issues, 
and never actually blocked anything except possibly some sub-ASCII control
characters.&nbsp; The correct approach (which we were also already doing) is
to do this validation on a per-variable basis in the context of each variable.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: don't try to create the UserBase WebConfig file if it's missing; just
load it if it's present.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: change the WebConfig file from fc_webconfig_prefs to [scriptname]_webconfig_prefs,
so that sites with multiple installations don't try to use the same one.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: the perfile-password feature was working for passwords set via
the upload form, but not for ones set via the file-list.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: templates for upload notification emails couldn't be set in the
filechucker_prefs_extra.cgi file (they would get overridden by defaults).
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: the email link on the options menu wasn't properly encoded in some
cases, so it would launch an email but some of the details would be missing.
</li>


<li>
Removed some old unused code and refactored some code.
</li>


</ul>














<p>v5.07 (20160511):</p>
<ul>


<li>
For the comment notification emails, switch to our standard email header/footer
for consistency and to remove redundancy in the prefs.
</li>

</ul>














<p>v5.06 (20160423):</p>
<ul>


<li>
FileChucker can now read the DB prefs from the UserBase WebConfig file, so if
you're using both apps, you won't have to enter those details twice.
</li>


<li>
Security enhancement: add secure and httponly options for our sensitive cookies,
and HTTP headers (sameorigin, nosniff...) for additional protection.
</li>


<li>
New feature $PREF{log_upload_info_to_text_file} for users who want simple
logging without a database.
</li>


<li>
Switch the page title from the FileChucker logo image to similarly-styled text.
</li>


<li>
Include FontAwesome by default since we're going to start using that.
</li>


<li>
Cleaned up the styling and spacing of the drop-down menus on the download page.
</li>


<li>
Ripped out an old feature that was virtually never used ($PREF{use_database_for_temp_data}).
</li>


<li>
For certain key settings (groups_allowed_to_, database prefs, salt...), remove
any newlines, which may slip in via WebConfig, etc.
</li>


<li>
Refactoring and other code cleanup.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: the $PREF{auto_create_userdirs} feature (formerly serial_is_userdir)
no longer creates an empty private subfolder each time the app is accessed; it
now waits until an upload occurs to create the subfolder for it.
</li>

</ul>














<p>v5.05 (20160216):</p>
<ul>

<li>
New setting $TEXT{intro_filelist} in case you want a separate message at the
top of that page.
</li>


<li>
Added a note to the top of the "All Prefs" page in WebConfig, explaining that
it shows prefs as they appear in the prefs file, not your customized prefs.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: clicking the Help link at the top of the WebConfig pages now works on
the first time (previously the first click was ignored).
</li>

</ul>














<p>v5.04 (20150911):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Big performance boost: roughly an order of magnitude faster during app
initialization, meaning every execution will be faster.&nbsp; On one test
server, execution time went from ~1.8 seconds down to 0.1 second.
</li>

<li>
New mobile-friendly design displays nicely on small screen devices like phones,
with little to no pinching and zooming required on most screens.
</li>

<li>
More details coming soon.
</li>

</ul>













<p>v5.03 (20150908):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Added a "spinner" graphic (which actually shows a matrix of moving squares
instead of a spinning circle) as a temporary placeholder for the upload progress
bar before it appears, and to display while sending test emails.
</li>


<li>
Performance boost: when interpolating variables into prefs etc, only read the
URL and cookie variables once each.
</li>


</ul>













<p>v5.02 (20150718):</p>
<ul>


<li>
<strong>New nested tree-view</strong> feature for the download page, via the
"enable_treestyle_download_page" setting.&nbsp; This lets you expand folders
to drill down into subfolders without reloading the page.
</li>


<li>
The image resizing/thumbnail features now support square thumbnails (via
cropping, not stretching).
</li>


<li>
Improvements and clarifications to the email configuration and send-test-email
pages.
</li>


<li>
Refactoring.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: in rare cases, at the end of an upload, the time remaining field would
go from 0 to some huge negative number.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: a recent update caused all old-file-deletions to fail, except for those
done via the targeted_autodelete feature.
</li>


</ul>













<p>v5.01 (20150417):</p>
<ul>


<li>
We'll now load the WebConfig prefs from UserBase if available, to avoid having
to re-enter common prefs like database settings.
</li>


</ul>













<p>v5.00 (20150413):</p>
<ul>


<li>
<strong>Introducing WebConfig!</strong>&nbsp; You can now do all of FileChucker's
configuration via web browser, without having to edit any config files.&nbsp; 
But the config files (prefs files) are still there, and can still be used, if
you prefer that method instead.
</li>


<li>
<strong>Security upgrade:</strong> FileChucker's authentication system has been
updated to a newer, stronger hash, and now also uses a per-site salt to further
strengthen the hashes, as well as a large number of hash iterations for additional
protection.
</li>


<li>
New interactive database-settings-config page, where you can enter your database
settings and test them via a single page in your web browser.
</li>


<li>
New interactive email-settings-config page, where you can enter your email
server details and test them (by sending a test email) via a single page in
your web browser.&nbsp; Very useful for when your email provider changes a
setting on you, or your emails just seem to stop arriving for some reason,
etc.&nbsp; The problem in those cases is virtually never with FileChucker,
but now it'll let you quickly pinpoint what IS causing it, and correct the
settings easily.
</li>

<li>
Many other improvements and bugfixes, with details coming soon.
</li>

</ul>














<p>v4.99e (20141022):</p>
<ul>


<li>
New include_simple_formfield_format_on_redirection_qs, so that in case you're
redirecting to a non-FC upload confirmation page, you can access simple 
name=value variables on the URL, rather than having to parse FileChucker's
special numbered-variable format.
</li>


<li>
New disable_multiple_files_in_one_element_for_mobilesafari setting, since
MobileSafari currently has a bug that prevents video files from uploading if
the file field has multi-file support enabled (as any modern file field will,
nowadays...).
</li>


<li>
New groupsallowed_settings_override_custfolderperms_for_file_downloads 
setting, for cases where you want to enable custom folder permissions so that
only your specified users/groups can browse folders, but still allow individual
file download links to be public (e.g. links sent in notification emails).
</li>


<li>
Removed a bunch of really old, virtually-never-used code, and optimized a bunch
of other code.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: the fancy new AJAX file-delete feature would mysteriously fail if you
were in the top level (not in a subfolder) and you tried to do a deletion using
the checkboxes instead of the options-&gt;delete link.
</li>


</ul>











<p>v4.99d (20140523):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Bugfix: we now only attempt to load the SFTP module if you've enabled a 
feature that requires it (e.g. use_sftp_when_transferring_to_another_server),
to prevent errors on servers where the module is missing.
</li>


</ul>











<p>v4.99c (20140513):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Bugfix: removed some development code that was inadvertently left in the
previous version.
</li>


</ul>











<p>v4.99b (20140513):</p>
<ul>


<li>
New $PREF{email_hello_domain} setting, which defaults to your domain name, which
is used in email headers -- previously this was just defaulted to
"localhost.localdomain"; this change *should* make it less likely that any
app-based emails get flagged as junk/spam by email servers, or services like
Gmail.
</li>


<li>
New scroll_progress_bar_into_view setting, in case your upload form is really
big, which previously might have made the upload progress bar scroll out of
view when the user clicked the Begin Upload button.
</li>


<li>
New optgroup setting for custom drop-down fields on the upload form, so you can
organize large drop-downs into groups.
</li>


<li>
The ftp_files_to_another_server feature now also supports SFTP.
</li>


<li>
On embedded installations where your page has an onload call in its body tag,
which prevents FileChucker's own onload code from running, we now automatically
detect that and run our code on the fly when the upload begins, rather than
displaying an error about enabling multiple onload actions, as before.
</li>


<li>
Switched some of our nonces from md5 to sha256, and we now include the
Digest::SHA::PurePerl module, for servers missing Digest::SHA, to guarantee
support.
</li>


<li>
New _maxlength setting for custom form fields.
</li>


<li>
The code that auto-updates our static CSS and JS files when you change your
prefs now also detects changes to the script itself, and does an update then.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: when using FileChucker with your own custom form field code, sometimes
FileChucker would fail to see some of your file input fields, if you had a
screwy form where the fields had duplicate names.
</li>


</ul>











<p>v4.99 (20140311):</p>
<ul>


<li>
New enable_folder_passwords feature, which will likely have multiple uses in
the future, but currently allows you to set folder-wide passwords that override
any per-file passwords on files within that folder.
</li>


<li>
New groups_allowed_to_bypass_perfile_passwords feature, to allow any group(s)
you choose to download files without needing the passwords, whereas previously
only admins could do this.
</li>


<li>
New treat_sendmail_closing_error_as_failed_delivery setting, required on some
servers where sendmail doesn't act quite right so we couldn't tell for sure
whether a message had been successfully sent.
</li>


<li>
We now automatically internally disable the multidownload feature when the
per-file password feature is enabled, rather than requiring it to be manually
disabled, since multidownload would bypass any per-file passwords.
</li>


<li>
New Test Email Sending link on the admin menu, for easier access to the ?do_email_test
page.
</li>


<li>
The email test page has been greatly improved, with a more detailed explanation
of which delivery methods were tried, which prefs need to be adjusted in the
event of a failed delivery, notes about required Perl modules and SMTP auth,
and where to find more help.
</li>


<li>
We're now using the mysql_auto_reconnect feature again, after a longstanding
bug in that Perl module was apparently fixed, meaning we no longer have to rely
on our own internal workaround for dropped MySQL connections, which is good
since it only worked about 99% of the time -- it was still possible for a
dropped connection to cause an error that we couldn't detect, if the drop
occurred at just the right (wrong) time.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: when email delivery fails and we retry 2 times before giving up, if
all 3 attempts failed, our error message said "attempt 4 of 3" instead of "3
of 3".
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: when using the per-file passwords feature, we would sometimes get stuck
in a redirect loop, preventing the file from downloading.
</li>


</ul>














<p>v4.98 (20140224):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Re-organized the prefs file to move shared prefs (mostly styling and text strings)
to a single section, to make multi-app installations easier to configure.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: on Apache/Windows servers, our uploaded_files_dir was sometimes set incorrectly.
</li>


</ul>














<p>v4.97 (20140210):</p>
<ul>


<li>
<strong>Nicer, quicker delete function:</strong> deleting files/folders is now
done via AJAX, so the page does not have to be reloaded afterwards.
</li>


<li>
The nice short ?show URLs introduced in the previous update are now used in 
more (most) of FileChucker's internally-generated links.
</li>


</ul>













<p>v4.96 (20140126):</p>
<ul>


<li>
<strong>New ?show=foo URL variable for nicer URLs</strong>.&nbsp; Previously, where you
would have had www.example.com/upload/?action=listfiles&amp;path=foo, the URL is 
now www.example.com/upload/?show=foo.&nbsp; It works for files too: instead of
www.example.com/upload/?action=viewer&amp;path=foo&amp;file=bar.jpg, you can use
www.example.com/upload/?show=foo/bar.jpg.
</li>


<li>
New enable_perfile_passwords_via_filelist feature, allowing you to set per-file
passwords on previously-uploaded files (which will then be required of anyone
trying to view/download the file), in addition to the previously-available
per-file passwords feature where the password is set during upload, which is
also still available.
</li>


<li>
New groups_allowed_to_view_2nd_level_of_download_page.&nbsp; This can be used
in conjunction with the groups_allowed_to_view_top_level_of_download_page and
groups_allowed_to_view_download_page features to create "public" yet relatively
secure download folders.&nbsp; For example, if you set groups_allowed_to_view_download_page
to public, but set the top_level and 2nd_level prefs to admin, then the only
way a member of the public can view anything is if it's in a very specific
subfolder whose address you intentionally give to him.&nbsp; E.g. if you have
/upload/files as your default upload/download location, then create /upload/files/private
and /upload/files/private/JohnnyExample-YYYYMMDD-C29A4BD1E3, then you could send
Johnny the link to the JohnnyExample-YYYYMMDD-C29A4BD1E3 folder and he 
could access it, yet he couldn't access the parent folder ("private/") nor any
other subfolders (because he wouldn't know their names without guessing or
brute-forcing it, which, for such long folder names, would be impractical).
</li>


<li>
<strong>New nicer-styled emails by default</strong> instead of plain-text
emails, and new email_wrapper_head and email_wrapper_foot prefs to easily
apply this style to any app-generated emails, and easily tweak it.
</li>


<li>
New static_css_url and static_js_url settings, and a new feature that creates
and updates them automatically, so that embedding FileChucker into a page in
your website is easier and loads faster.
</li>


<li>
New enable_targeted_autodelete feature, to allow auto-deletion of files and/or
folders based on arbitrary rules including pattern matching, specific subfolders,
age, etc.
</li>


<li>
New enable_comments_on_folders feature, in addition to the previously-available
file comments feature, so visitors (or just you) can leave comments on folders
in addition to files.
</li>


<li>
New script_redirect and custom redirect features for the file_links_in_*_go_to
settings, for more flexibility in specifing how your download links work and
where they go.
</li>


<li>
The options menu on the download page is now a little nicer, with tighter text
and a drop shadow.
</li>


<li>
The are-you-sure-you-want-to-delete-this prompts on the download page now include
the name of the file/folder in question.
</li>


</ul>














<p>v4.95 (20131126):</p>
<ul>


<li>
<strong>New mail-retry feature,</strong> so that when we try to send an email
but it fails, we'll automatically retry 2 times right away.&nbsp; Of course this
can't overcome sending errors that are due to a misconfiguration of your prefs,
but it helps greatly whenever there's a temporary glitch with a mailserver, which
happens surprisingly often.
</li>


<li>
<strong>New $PREF{log_all_sent_mail} feature,</strong> including a viewer so you can browse all
the mail sent by FileChucker.&nbsp; Helpful for debugging mail-sending problems,
or if you just like to keep a log of all outgoing mail.
</li>


<li>
FileChucker's internal mail-sending function now allows the To: parameter to be
a list of multiple recipients, which means in any pref/feature where you
specify a recipient email address, you can now include multiple recipients (of
course many such prefs/features already supported this in a different way, but
now it works for all emails).
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: the create_resized_copies_of_uploaded_images feature, when set to
use relative pathnames, would ignore any specified subdirectory on the upload
when creating the copies; now it mirrors the upload subdir into the copy
directory.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: enabling skip_database_table_creation on an installation that had been
updated from a previous one would result in wrong table names being used (no
data would be lost, but you'd be using new empty tables because their names
would be different).
</li>


</ul>













<p>v4.94 (20131026):</p>
<ul>


<li>
Performance boost: 
decreased the number of iterations in the expand_custom_vars_in_prefs___inner
sub (used for allowing prefs to be set with values of other prefs, i.e. nested)
in a way that can cut a few hundred MS off our execution time without any other
effect on the app.
</li>


<li>
Performance boost: new skip_database_table_creation pref, which can speed up
load time quite a bit depending on your server and database server, since
technically we only need to check/create the tables the first time we run and
once after each update.
</li>


<li>
Improved blocking of XSS attack attempts (of course most browsers now block
such attacks at the browser-level anyway).
</li>


<li>
New max_file_size_for_public, _members, and _admins settings, similar to the
existing sizelimit_for_public (etc) settings, except per-file instead of
per-upload.
</li>


<li>
New runtime-alert feature ($PREF{runtime_emailalert_time_limit}), to send you
email alerts when FileChucker's runtime exceeds a certain number of seconds.&nbsp; 
This can alert you to problems such as server overload, corrupt uploaded files,
or any other issue that might cause the app to take too long to run.&nbsp; 
There's a separate setting for uploads ($PREF{runtime_emailalert_time_limit_for_uploads})
since those will often take longer for large files, and which isn't a problem
in that case.
</li>


<li>
New encodable_app_template_static_css and _js prefs, for use with the
encodable_app_template_file feature, for improved performance when using the
template (avoiding 2 calls to the script by using static files instead).
</li>


<li>
Reorganized email prefs and improved their documentation.
</li>


<li>
New $PREF{webmaster_email_address} and $PREF{app_email_address} settings to
serve as defaults for other email prefs.
</li>


<li>
New enable_database_connection setting, for situations where you're using
custom code that requires a database, but aren't using any of FileChucker's
built-in database-using features, which would enable the database connection
automatically.
</li>


<li>
New max_image_dims_to_resize setting, which causes FileChucker to skip resizing
images (e.g. for thumbnails) that are very large in terms of their resolution
(but not necessarily large in file size, which the existing max_image_size_to_resize
setting would catch), since trying to resize such images can quickly consume 
all of the server's RAM.
</li>


<li>
New static_hostname setting, for servers on networks where there are long
delays for hostname lookups, which would previously cause FileChucker to take
a long time to load, since it had to wait for the lookup.&nbsp; Now you can
manually set your hostname and skip the lookup.
</li>


<li>
New code to check for invalid/non-standard/otherwise-screwy remote IP addresses
and fix them when possible.
</li>


<li>
New code to set UserBase's table names automatically, rather than from
the userbase_prefs.cgi file, for installations that are integrated with
UserBase.
</li>


<li>
Removed note about 7-Zip from the error message we show when a multi-file
download fails due to the zip file not existing (the note is for Windows users
and explains that they'll need to install a zip command such as the one from
Info-ZIP or 7-Zip, but it appears current versions of 7-Zip don't work when
called this way).
</li>


<li>
Various small improvements to our database-viewer pages.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: when using the $PREF{admin_user_present} setting (not used by default
nor in most installations) and setting it to '%ENV{PHP_ENC_ISADMIN}' as
suggested in the prefs file, it would always evaluate to true, because of a
bug in the way we were interpolating the %ENV vars.&nbsp; This bug would also
apply to any other prefs set to strings containing only a single (undefined)
%ENV variable, but there aren't any other such prefs by default.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: we no longer set the PATH env var to a sane Linux/Unix value if we're
running on a Windows server.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: in some error cases we displayed a vague "Message expired" error; now
we'll display more about what really went wrong.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: the Upload Complete page's "Return to upload page" link would be a
broken link (missing a question-mark) in some rare cases.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: when using a filechucker_prefs_extra.cgi file (which isn't used by
default), and changing certain $PREF{upload_email_template_for_*} email
settings within it, those settings would be ignored, with the default versions
of the prefs from the main prefs file used instead.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: we now use Javascript to add the 'multiple="multiple"' attribute to
the file upload fields (which is what tells the browser to enable the
multi-files-within-one-element feature) instead of having it there in the HTML
code by default, to appease the validator.&nbsp; As a consequence there is also
a new allow_multiple_files_in_one_element pref for the rare case where you'd
want to disable this feature.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: moved the onload for the upload progress bar from HTML to Javascript to
appease the validator.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: minor and inconsequential change to a comment within our CSS to appease
the validator.
</li>


<li>
Bugfix: replaced a few ampersands with their HTML equivalents to appease
the validator.
</li>


</ul>














<p>v4.93 (20130831):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Small prefs change: added note to the top of the file pointing out that most
prefs are optional and can be left at their default values.
</li>

</ul>














<p>v4.92 (20130510):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Bugfix: the previous update caused a syntax error on older versions of Perl, so
rolling it back for now.
</li>

</ul>














<p>v4.91 (20130505):</p>
<ul>

<li>
New use_unicode_in_sql_safety_checks feature, necessary on some servers with
some languages.
</li>

</ul>
















<p>v4.90 (20130429):</p>
<ul>

<li>
<strong>New comments feature</strong>, allowing visitors to post comments on
previously-uploaded files.&nbsp; Useful in situations where you're using
FileChucker as a photo album, or for receiving notes from your clients on their
uploaded files, or for <em>sending</em> notes to clients regarding their
uploaded files, etc.&nbsp; Includes email notification of new comments, and
optional admin moderation of new comments.&nbsp; See $PREF{enable_comments}.
</li>



<li>
New uploaded_files_dir___admin setting, for rare situations where you've got
the normal uploaded_files_dir being set via some kind of user variable, and you
want to specify a different directory for admin (non-user) access.
</li>



<li>
New admin_user_present setting for when integrating with a third-party login
system, as another way to signify admin presence.
</li>



<li>
FileChucker can now display in-page preview images for TIFF files, by creating
JPG previews of them, since most browsers can't display the TIFF format.
</li>

</ul>













<p>v4.89 (20130129):</p>
<ul>

<li>
The $PREF{encodable_app_template_file} feature no longer requires that you put
the %%css%% and %%js%% variables in your template file; we'll just automatically
insert our CSS and JS either right after the &lt;head&gt; tag, or right before
the &lt;/head&gt; tag.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{force_nocache_on_all_output} setting, required only on rare goofy
servers that automatically cache our app output on the *server* side.
</li>



<li>
New code to block potential XSS attacks.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: formfields excluded from the upload form via the
$PREF{formfield_NN_only_for_these_groups} setting were still being included
in notification emails; now they're excluded there too.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.88 (20120919):</p>
<ul>

<li>
New $PREF{use_NetSMTP_for_email} setting, needed only for a small percentage of
(cranky) email servers.
</li>



<li>
For upload notification emails, you can now specify a Reply-To address, in
addition to a From address.
</li>



<li>
If you're using the $PREF{encodable_app_template_file} feature (which is
basically an alternate way to do an <a href="#embed">embed</a>), you can use
the new $PREF{encodable_app_template_replacement_001} settings to specify text
to be replaced within the template file, e.g. replacing a standard header image
with a different one for each logged-in user.
</li>



<li>
New rawname URL variable for the Upload Complete page (and stored in the upload
info table if enabled), to access the filename as submitted before we applied
any of your specified modifications.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{email_link_on_options_menu___folder} setting, to easily email a link
to any folder on your download page.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.87 (20120806):</p>
<ul>

<li>
<strong>New multi-item move feature:</strong> heretofore you could only move files
and folders one at a time; now you can use the checkboxes and the Actions Menu at
the bottom of the downloads page to move multiple files/folders at the same
time.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{preview_videos_in_viewer_mode} setting, so that in the preview/slideshow
viewer, where images are shown as web-sized versions with links to the full
version, videos are now shown the same way (as opposed to just showing a link 
to the video file, as we do for non-previewable file types like text files).
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{enable_username_from_cgi_script} feature.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{title_text} setting to specify the title that appears in places where
HTML isn't allowed, such as the browser's title bar.
</li>



<li>
New settings $PREF{file_upload_field_N_is_required} (where N is 2, 3, 4, etc)
for installations with multiple required file fields.
</li>



<li>
New setting $PREF{disable_upload_iframe_for_these_user_agents}, to work around
bugs in particular browsers.
</li>



<li>
For drop-down form fields populated from SQL queries, the allowed query format
is more flexible (e.g. allowing SELECT DISTINCT in addition to just SELECT).
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{formfield_NN_maxlength} feature, to limit the length of input values
in single-line form fields.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{hide_filenames_in_filelist} feature, used for example when all your
uploaded files are images or videos and thus will have thumbnails, and you
want just that small image displayed with no text.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{hide_parent_folder_link_in_file_list} setting.
</li>



<li>
Removed all the old style/theme code, CSS, and prefs (e.g. $PREF{light___filelist_row_hover_bgcolor})
in favor of a new simpler system with just two themes: light and dark.
</li>



<li>
Removed the $PREF{enable_individual_item_viewer_mode} setting (it had actually
been ignored since v4.66 in favor of the new file_links_in_ settings in that
version).
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{database_tablename_prefix} setting (defaults to "fc_"), for sites
with multiple FileChucker installations where you want to use separate database
tables for each one.
</li>



<li>
Renamed $PREF{file_and_dir_info_table} to $PREF{pathinfo_table}, and changed
its default value from "file_and_dir_info" to "pathinfo".
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{extra_sql_safe_characters} setting, in case you want to allow other
characters to be stored in your database than the ASCII ones that FileChucker
allows by default.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{static_error_message} setting, in case (after you've got FileChucker
all installed and configured) you want any error to display a simple static
message (e.g. "Server Error") instead of a detailed error message.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{server_handles_ip_addresses_incorrectly} setting, for servers that
don't provide accurate/consistent identification of client IP addresses via
environment variables.&nbsp; This is unnecessary on 99% of servers, and it only
affects certain error/confirmation messages that the app generates: normally
we restrict these based on logged-in status, or IP address, but with this setting
enabled, we'll allow the message to be shown with no restriction, but we'll 
also auto-expire it quickly to minimize the (already remote) chance that the
message could be viewed by someone other than the visitor who generated it.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{always_show_details_for_move_and_copy_operations} setting: normally
we only display a results page for these operations if an error occurs, but
with this setting we'll show the list of items successfully moved/copied.
</li>



<li>
Various CSS tweaks.
</li>



<li>
Reorganized some of the sections at the end of the prefs file.
</li>



<li>
We now support the Digest::SHA module, in addition to Digest::SHA1, for servers
where the latter isn't installed.
</li>



<li>
New %QS hash to allow you to use variables from the URL's query-string within
your prefs file (e.g. "%QS{foo}" will turn into "bar" if ?foo=bar is passed on
the URL).
</li>



<li>
We now specify accept-charset="UTF-8" on our &lt;form&gt;s, which should resolve
some internationalization issues.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.86 (20120416):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Simplified the <a href="/filechucker/faq/#embed">embedding process</a> so that
the $PREF{print_full_html_tags} setting is no longer required.&nbsp; Now when
FileChucker is embedded within a different page, the full filechucker.cgi URL
will continue to work properly as well.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.85 (20120404):</p>
<ul>

<li>
<strong>Now supports <a href="faq/#cornerstore">integration</a> with
<a href="/cornerstore/">CornerStore</a></strong>, so you can easily sell
products and services based on the uploaded files in FileChucker.
</li>




<li>Prefs added:
<br />groups_allowed_to_view_buy_links_db
<br />groups_allowed_to_edit_buy_links
<br />groups_allowed_to_create_buy_links
<br />groups_allowed_to_delete_buy_links
<br />integrate_with_cornerstore
<br />show_buy_column_in_filelist
<br />cornerstore_cgi_location
<br />cornerstore_buy_link_separator
<br />cornerstore_item_table_list
<br />cornerstore_buy_link
<br />file_and_dir_info_table
</li>

</ul>
















<p>v4.84 (20120325):</p>
<ul>

<li>
For uploads containing multiple files and per-file form fields, there is now
a link to auto-fill the form fields using the values from the fields on the
previous file.
</li>



<li>
We now use accept-charset="UTF-8" on the upload form, which should allow
unicode characters in form fields to be processed correctly.
</li>



<li>
Replaced $PREF{path_to_filelist_images} with $PREF{app_images_url} for
standardization across multiple apps.
</li>



<li>
When server write-caching prevents the upload progress bar from working
properly, the message displayed is more end-user friendly.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{static_error_message} setting, in case you want to hide all real
error messages and show a more generic/short/friendly error instead.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{always_use_nonforking_code_when_sending_email} setting, which can
help work around email issues on screwy servers.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: sometimes a spurious "couldn't rmdir (delete) directory" would be
displayed (when FileChucker was cleaning up old files/folders) because of the
way we were checking for empty directories.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: when using the custom folder permissions feature, any permissions set
on the very top level (/) would fail to show up as inherited permissions when
viewing the levels below it (though the actual permissions were still enforced
correctly).
</li>



<li>
Prefs added:
<br />app_images_url
<br />always_use_nonforking_code_when_sending_email
<br />static_error_message
</li>



<li>
Prefs removed:
<br />path_to_filelist_images
</li>

</ul>
















<p>v4.83 (20120130):</p>
<ul>

<li>
New $PREF{extra_header_output} to allow you to include a custom favicon, or to
integrate with <a href="/visitorlog/">VisitorLog</a>, etc.
</li>



<li>
You can now pass ?dirlist=foo on the URL to the upload page, to hide any folders
in the "Upload to:" drop-down field (if enabled) that don't match foo.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{enable_username_from_environment_variable} feature, which is just what
it sounds like, for integration with non-UserBase login systems.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{subgroup_*} settings (see below) to enable more fine-grained control
over folder permissions when using UserBase's subgroup manager feature.
</li>



<li>
When using $PREF{store_upload_info_in_database}, there are now two new fields
stored by default: rawname and extension.&nbsp; rawname is the original filename
from the client, before any serialization or $PREF{reformat_filenames_for_all_uploads}
options, etc, are applied.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{debuglog} setting to make debugging easier, especially on servers
without decent built-in error logs, or where the host won't let you access the
error log.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: if you added more than 99 form fields to the upload form, only the first
99 would work properly.
</li>



<li>
Prefs added:
<br />enable_username_from_environment_variable
<br />username_envvar_name
<br />subgroup_owned_users_have_same_folder_perms_as_their_subgroup_manager
<br />subgroup_owned_users_can_read_the_userdir_of_their_subgroup_manager
<br />subgroup_owned_users_can_write_the_userdir_of_their_subgroup_manager
<br />hide_toplevel_userdir_shortcut_for_subgroup_owned_users
<br />extra_header_output
<br />debuglog
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.82 (20111026):</p>
<ul>

<li>
New $PREF{show_myaccount_link} setting for when integrated with UserBase; this
is in addition to $PREF{show_login_link}, which is now a dedicated login/logout
link (in previous versions, it changed to a My Account link when integrated
with UB).
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.81 (20111026):</p>
<ul>

<li>
New method for detecting when the upload is complete in the iframe, which
eliminates a ~1-2 second delay at the end of uploads before the Upload Complete
message is displayed, and which also allows us to detect and display any server
errors that occur during an upload.
</li>



<li>
We now cache any environment variables received from PHP, so that we're able to
use them during POSTs (e.g. uploads).
</li>



<li>
The get_userdir_from_username and get_userdir_from_email prefs have been
replaced by enable_userdir_from_login_system and userdir_template, which now
also supports including the user's email address and user ID within the userdir
value.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{uploadbutton_id} setting, for situations where you're integrating
with an existing complex form where it'd be a hassle to change the CSS ID of
the upload button, so you can adjust it in FileChucker instead.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{ignore_image_resizing_errors} setting, to suppress errors during
thumbnail generation, which, on a server with a properly-functioning image
module/library, are generally only caused by the occasional corrupt image
file, which we can't do anything about anyway, so displaying an error is
largely pointless.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{css_shared} setting, for CSS that is common to multiple Encodable
apps.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: on some servers, small uploads and/or slow connections result in the
write-caching error being displayed when it doesn't actually apply, so we now
wait until we're at least a few seconds into the upload before displaying it.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: on some servers, at the end of an upload, the upload size would appear
to revert to a very small value, causing the time displays on the upload
progress table to freak out; we now ignore any decreasing values for the
size, so this issue no longer occurs.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: with custom folder permissions enabled, viewing the permissions would
result in an error on Windows servers.
</li>



<li>
Prefs added:
<br />enable_userdir_from_login_system
<br />userdir_template
<br />uploadbutton_id
<br />ignore_image_resizing_errors
<br />css_shared
</li>



<li>
Prefs removed: 
<br />get_userdir_from_username
<br />get_userdir_from_email
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.80 (20111006):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Bugfix: when using the human test (aka CAPTCHA) feature, we'd eventually
display an error when auto-deleting the old human test images, because of
an incomplete directory check.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.79 (20111005):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Bugfix: when deleting a directory, we would display a MySQL error if custom
folder permissions were not enabled.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.78 (20110929):</p>
<ul>

<li>
We now include the version number in the prefs file too, to make things easier
for those with multiple installations, and during updates/moves, etc.
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.77 (20110901):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Changelog coming soon.
</li>



</ul>















<p>v4.76 (20110715):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Changelog coming soon.
</li>



</ul>















<p>v4.75 (20110609):</p>
<ul>

<li>
New $PREF{show_keep_me_logged_in_checkbox_on_login_page} setting, in case you
want to disable that checkbox, which was previously always shown.
</li>



<li>
New $PREF{ignore_chosen_subdir_during_upload_if_new_subdir_entered} setting, 
for situations where you want any new subdirs to be forced into the top level,
instead of inside an existing subdir.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: we were failing to store upload info into the database for file-less
form submissions (if both of those option were enabled).
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.74 (20110501):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Changelog coming soon.
</li>



</ul>















<p>v4.73 (20110326):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Changelog coming soon.
</li>



</ul>















<p>v4.72 (20110321):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Bugfix: when integrated with UserBase, and pulling the login_url value from the
UserBase prefs file, we'd set it to the wrong value if it was still set to the
default of $ENV{SCRIPT_NAME} (setting it to filechucker.cgi instead of
userbase.cgi).
</li>

</ul>















<p>v4.71 (20110319):</p>
<ul>

<li>
Bugfix: the pagination links on the filelist page were supposed to be hidden
when they weren't needed (i.e. when the number of items is less than your
num-items-per-page setting), but that wasn't happening.
</li>



<li>
Bugfix: the filelist page was displaying a "Buy" header (which is part of an
upcoming feature still under development) when it shouldn't have been.
</li>

I looked all over trying to find a simple cgi script.&nbsp; I found that FileChucker was by far the best.&nbsp; If you have issues with your hosting service's php.ini max upload size then this is the way to go.&nbsp; Looking forward to future enhancements.

Do you know how rare it is to have a "canned" shopping cart that can easily do complex pricing options on a single item?&nbsp; Basically, they don't exist!&nbsp; I have looked.&nbsp; Everywhere!&nbsp; And the few that might even come close to CornerStore's functionality cost a fortune!

FileChucker is a great drop-in solution for file uploads, and worth every penny of its very reasonable cost.&nbsp; Encodable's support is excellent to boot.

I just want to say you guys really stand alone in that you have a quality product and you provide genuine customer service.&nbsp; It's sad but those qualities are seldom found separately, much less together.&nbsp; Thanks again for your time and help.

I just installed the demo of your product and got it up and running in no time.&nbsp; I searched high and low for a decent login script and thank God I found yours.

Thank you VERY much for all of your help.&nbsp; You've really impressed me.&nbsp; We have support agreements for other software that costs thousands of dollars / year (just for the support), and most of them aren't as helpful as you have been.

The amount of customization in the program is incredible.&nbsp; I was able to integrate it into my existing page layout relatively simply.&nbsp; I was also able to easily customize the look/feel to match the current site.

FileChucker is helping drive the backend of several high profile entertainment sites for people like Shania Twain and Dolly Parton.&nbsp; We're also using it to drive backend file uploads for a multi-billion dollar banking institution.&nbsp; It's a great product.&nbsp; We've tried other "chucking" upload solutions with progress bars using flash and php, but nothing works as reliably as FileChucker.

I want to thank you for your efforts on Userbase. It has become an integral part of our business and has allowed us to branch out and begin using automation on a lot of our processes. Userbase has become the gateway to advancement for our company's processes for our clients and employees.

Just one word: Fantastic.&nbsp; 10-minute job to plug FileChucker into my app, and it now works a treat.&nbsp; It's through the hard work by people like yourselves that make my job so much easier.&nbsp; Congratulations on an outstanding product... Many many thanks.

I just wanted to say that yours is the first product that I've tested so far that hasn't failed on handling uploads.&nbsp; This is going to work for a print company, so they are handling nothing but large files and all the other solutions I've tried so far have not been reliable.&nbsp; So far yours has been 100% successful in my tests.
