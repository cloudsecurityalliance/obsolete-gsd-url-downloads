<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older version of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which versions are affected. Other versions are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>
<p>It should be a priority for customers who have older versions of the software to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>. For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Product Support Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p>Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Worldwide Information Web site</a>, select the country, and then click <strong>Go</strong> to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager.

Version Number Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0934  
--------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Visio handles a specially crafted version number in a Visio (.VSD, VSS, or .VST) file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Visio does not correctly validate the version number field when processing the contents of a file. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a malicious or compromised Web site.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0934](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-0934).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Version Number Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0934
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.  
-   Microsoft Office Visio 2007 is not affected by this vulnerability.
  
#### Workarounds for Version Number Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0934
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Use Microsoft Visio Viewer 2003 or Microsoft Visio Viewer 2007 to open and view files. Microsoft Visio Viewer 2003 and Microsoft Visio Viewer 2007 are not affected by the issue. Users can download the [Microsoft Visio Viewer 2003](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=3fb3bd5c-fed1-46cf-bd53-da23635ab2df) and [Microsoft Visio Viewer 2007](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d88e4542-b174-4198-ae31-6884e9edd524&displaylang=en) from the Microsoft Download Center.  
-   Do not open or save Microsoft Visio files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources.

**What causes the vulnerability?**  
Microsoft Visio does not correctly validate the version number field when processing version related data of a file.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code on a user’s system. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Visio file with an affected version of Microsoft Visio.
  
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.
  
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Visio file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**  
Workstations and terminal servers that have Microsoft Visio installed are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Visio handles the validation of Visio file version related data.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. This security bulletin addresses the privately disclosed vulnerability as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
  
Visio Document Packaging Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0936  
------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Visio as a result of the way it incorrectly handles the parsing of packed objects within the Visio file format. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by constructing a malicious Visio (.VSD, VSS, or .VST) file that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or opened a specially crafted Visio attachment included in an e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2007-0936](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2007-0936).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Visio Document Packaging Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0936
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability In addition, Web sites that accept or host user-provided content, or compromised Web sites and advertisement servers could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.  
-   Microsoft Office Visio 2007 is not affected by this vulnerability.
  
#### Workarounds for Visio Document Packaging Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0936
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Use Microsoft Visio Viewer 2003 or Microsoft Visio Viewer 2007 to open and view files. Microsoft Visio Viewer 2003 and Microsoft Visio Viewer 2007 are not affected by the issue. Users can download the [Microsoft Visio Viewer 2003](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=3fb3bd5c-fed1-46cf-bd53-da23635ab2df) and [Microsoft Visio Viewer 2007](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=d88e4542-b174-4198-ae31-6884e9edd524&displaylang=en) from the Microsoft Download Center.  
-   Do not open or save Microsoft Visio files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the setup switches supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section.
  
**Note.** If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en) Redistributable  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337)Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package Installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**    
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**    
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
<pre><code>    **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  

    **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
