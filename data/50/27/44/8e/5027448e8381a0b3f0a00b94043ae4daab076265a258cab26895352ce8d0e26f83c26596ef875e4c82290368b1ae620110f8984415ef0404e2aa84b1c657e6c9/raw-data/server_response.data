<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-excel-could-allow-remote-code-execution-2587505">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2587505)</h2>
<p>Published: September 13, 2011 | Updated: October 11, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. Installing and configuring Office File Validation (OFV) to prevent the opening of suspicious files blocks the attack vectors for exploiting the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1986 and CVE-2011-1987. See the section, <strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</strong>, for more information about how the Office File Validation feature can be configured to block the attack vectors.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Office 2007, Microsoft Excel 2010, Microsoft Office 2010, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and all supported versions of Microsoft Excel Viewer, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack, Microsoft Excel Services installed on SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft Excel Services installed on SharePoint Server 2010, and Microsoft Excel Web App 2010. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Excel manages objects in memory, indexes an array of memory locations, parses certain records in Excel files, handles a particular type of conditional expression, and conducts bounds checking on array index values. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>. For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating" data-linktype="external">Understanding Windows automatic updating</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2587505" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2587505</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why was this bulletin revised on October 11, 2011?</strong><br/>
Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce a detection logic change for update KB2553094 for Excel Services installed on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 Service Pack 1. This is a change to detection logic only that addresses an offering issue with non-security update KB2510639 for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010.</p>
<p>There were no changes to the security update files. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
Refer to the reference tables in the <strong>Security Update Deployment</strong> section for the location of the file information details.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this update only rated Important for all affected versions of Excel?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Excel 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.</p>
<p><strong>How could the Office File Validation feature help to mitigate the vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
When the Office File Validation feature is enabled in Microsoft Excel 2003, specially crafted files that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1986 and CVE-2011-1987 are not opened automatically; instead, by default, the user is prompted to choose whether or not to open such a file. A user would have to click through the warning to open the file before the vulnerabilities could be exploited. For more information about Office File Validation in Microsoft Excel 2003, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2501584.mspx" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 2501584</a>.</p>
<p>When the Office File Validation feature is enabled in Microsoft Excel 2007, specially crafted files that could be used to exploit the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-1987 are not opened automatically; instead, by default, the user is prompted to choose whether or not to open such a file. A user would have to click through the warning to open the file before the vulnerabilities could be exploited. For more information about Office File Validation in Microsoft Excel 2007, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2501584.mspx" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 2501584</a>.</p>
<p>Office File Validation is enabled by default in Microsoft Excel 2010. Specially crafted files that could be used to exploit the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1987 fail validation and open in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/office2010.aspx" data-linktype="external">Protected View</a>; the user then must click through several warning messages before the file can be opened for editing and the vulnerabilities could be exploited.</p>
<p><strong>What is the benefit if I disable the opening of files that fail file validation in Excel 2003?</strong><br/>
By setting Office File Validation to not allow the opening of suspicious files in Excel 2003, the <strong>Microsoft Fix it</strong> solution, &quot;Disable the opening of documents for Excel 2003 and 2007&quot; available in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584</a>, blocks the attack vectors for exploiting the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-1986 and CVE-2011-1987.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584</a> for instructions on applying the automated Fix it solution, &quot;Disable the opening of documents for Excel 2003 and 2007,&quot; or refer to the Workaround sections for CVE-2011-1986 and CVE-2011-1987 in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin for instructions on applying the solution manually.</p>
<p><strong>What is the benefit if I disable the opening of files that fail file validation in Excel 2007?</strong><br/>

<p>Refer to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584</a> for instructions on applying the automated Fix it solution, &quot;Disable the opening of documents for Excel 2003 and 2007,&quot; or refer to the Workaround section for CVE-2011-1987 in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin for instructions on applying the solution manually.</p>
<p><strong>What is the benefit if I disable the opening of files that fail file validation in Excel 2010?</strong><br/>
The automated <strong>Microsoft Fix it</strong> solution, &quot;Disable Edit in Protected View for Excel 2010,&quot; available in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584</a>, blocks the attack vectors for exploiting CVE-2011-1987. Customers may choose to apply the Fix it solution as a workaround if choosing not to install the security update for Excel 2010 until a later time.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584</a> for instructions on applying the automated Fix it solution, &quot;Disable Edit in Protected View for Excel 2010,&quot; or refer to the Workaround section for CVE-2011-1987 in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin for instructions on applying the solution manually.</p>
<p><strong>Why are multiple update packages available for Microsoft Office 2007?</strong><br/>
The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different update packages as indicated in the <strong>Affected Software</strong> table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft Office 2007.</p>
<p><strong>Why are multiple update packages available for Microsoft Office 2010?</strong><br/>
The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different update packages as indicated in the <strong>Affected Software</strong> table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft Office 2010.</p>
<p><strong>I use Microsoft Excel 2007 or Microsoft Excel 2010. Do I need to install all the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?</strong><br/>
Yes. Customers should apply all update packages offered for the software installed on their systems.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?</strong><br/>
No, the updates can be installed in any order.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?</strong><br/>
The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Microsoft Excel Viewer?</strong><br/>
The Microsoft Excel Viewer is a replacement for all previous Excel Viewer versions, including Excel Viewer 97 and Excel Viewer 2003. With Excel Viewer, you can open, view, and print Excel workbooks, even if you don't have Excel installed. You can also copy data from Excel Viewer to another program. However, you cannot edit data, save a workbook, or create a new workbook.</p>
<p><strong>How</strong> <strong>areMicrosoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Excel is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Excel that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?</strong><br/>
Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I being offered the KB2553089 and KB2553090 updates for Microsoft Office 2007 in a Microsoft Excel bulletin?</strong>  
You are being offered the KB2553089 and KB2553090 updates for Microsoft Office 2007 because the updates apply to a shared component of Microsoft Office that contains the vulnerable code. The attack vectors only pertain to Microsoft Excel; other Microsoft Office products include the vulnerable shared component but do not access the vulnerable code.</p>
<p><strong>Why am I being offered the KB2553091 and KB2553096 updates for Microsoft Office 2010 in a Microsoft Excel bulletin?</strong>  
You are being offered the KB2553091 and KB2553096 updates for Microsoft Excel 2010 because the updates apply to a shared component of Microsoft Office that contains the vulnerable code. The attack vectors only pertain to Microsoft Excel; other Microsoft Office products include the vulnerable shared component but do not access the vulnerable code.</p>
<p><strong>Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?</strong><br/>
No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects versions of the files on the system that are lower than the ones in the update package and thus offers the update.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a> Web site.</p>

<h2 id="excel-use-after-free-writeav-vulnerability---cve-2011-1986">Excel Use after Free WriteAV Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1986</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-1986" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-1986</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-excel-use-after-free-writeav-vulnerability---cve-2011-1986">Mitigating Factors for Excel Use after Free WriteAV Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1986</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-excel-use-after-free-writeav-vulnerability---cve-2011-1986">Workarounds for Excel Use after Free WriteAV Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1986</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set Office File Validation to disable the opening of files that fail validation in Excel 2003</strong></li>

<pre><code>**Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.

The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.

To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;amp;displaylang=en).

MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit [Microsoft Update](http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx) to install all recommended updates.

**Enable MOICE**

**Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.

<h4 id="faq-for-excel-use-after-free-writeav-vulnerability---cve-2011-1986">FAQ for Excel Use after Free WriteAV Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1986</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Excel incorrectly handles objects in memory.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used, such as workstations, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Excel manages objects in memory.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Excel improperly indexes an array of memory locations.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used, such as workstations, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Excel indexes an array of memory locations</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-1988" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-1988</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-excel-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2011-1988">Mitigating Factors for Excel Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1988</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>

<h4 id="workarounds-for-excel-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2011-1988">Workarounds for Excel Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1988</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

**For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007**

The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).

**Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied. In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

<h4 id="faq-for-excel-conditional-expression-parsing-vulnerability---cve-2011-1989">FAQ for Excel Conditional Expression Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1989</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Excel fails to correctly parse an expression used for determining formatting requirements.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used, such as workstations, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft Excel handles a particular type of conditional expression.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="excel-out-of-bounds-array-indexing-vulnerability---cve-2011-1990">Excel Out of Bounds Array Indexing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1990</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-1990" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-1990</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-excel-out-of-bounds-array-indexing-vulnerability---cve-2011-1990">Mitigating Factors for Excel Out of Bounds Array Indexing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1990</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-excel-out-of-bounds-array-indexing-vulnerability---cve-2011-1990">Workarounds for Excel Out of Bounds Array Indexing Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1990</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>Microsoft Office File Block policy can be used to block specific file format types from opening in Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint.

**For Microsoft Office 2007**

The following registry scripts can be saved in registry entry (.reg) files and used to set the File Block policy. For more information on how to use registry scripts, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 310516](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310516).

**Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.

For customers remaining on SMS 2003 Service Pack 3, the [Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sms/bb676783.aspx) (ITMU) is also an option.
  
For SMS 2003, the SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates (ITMU) can be used by SMS to detect security updates that are offered by [Microsoft Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) and that are supported by [Windows Server Update Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120). For more information about the SMS 2003 ITMU, see [SMS 2003 Inventory Tool for Microsoft Updates](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sms/bb676783.aspx). For more information about SMS scanning tools, see [SMS 2003 Software Update Scanning Tools](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sms/bb676786.aspx). See also [Downloads for Systems Management Server 2003](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sms/bb676766.aspx).
  
System Center Configuration Manager 2007 uses WSUS 3.0 for detection of updates. For more information about Configuration Manager 2007 Software Update Management, visit [System Center Configuration Manager 2007](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb735860.aspx).

For more detailed information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723): Summary list of monthly detection and deployment guidance articles.
  
**Note for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007** The detection table described above is based on single-server Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 deployments. The detection tools do not detect the applicability of the update on systems configured as part of multiple-system SharePoint server farms. For more information about deploying updates on both stand-alone and multi server configurations, see the TechNet article, [Deploy software updates for Office SharePoint Server 2007](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc263467(office.12).aspx).
  
**Note** If you have used an Administrative Installation Point (AIP) for deploying Office XP or Office 2003, you may not be able to deploy the update using SMS if you have updated the AIP from the original baseline. For more information, see the **Office Administrative Installation Point** heading in this section.
  
**Office Administrative Installation Point**
  
If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system.
  
-   For supported versions of Microsoft Office XP, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/orkxp/ha011363091033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client system from an updated administrative installation point to an Office XP original baseline source, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922665](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922665).    
    **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article [Updating Office XP Clients from a Patched Administrative Image](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/orkxp/ha011525721033.aspx).  
-   For supported versions of Microsoft Office 2003, see [Creating an Administrative Installation Point](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/ork2003/ha011401931033.aspx). For more information on how to change the source for a client computer from an updated administrative installation point to an Office 2003 original baseline source or Service Pack 3 (SP3), see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 902349](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/902349).    
    **Note** If you plan to manage software updates centrally from an updated administrative image, you can find more information in the article, [Distributing Office 2003 Product Updates](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/ork2003/ha011402381033.aspx?pid=ch011480761033).  
-   For creating a network installation point for supported versions of Microsoft Office, see [Create a network installation point for Microsoft Office](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179063.aspx).    
    **Note** If you plan to manage security updates centrally, use Windows Server Update Services. For more information about how to deploy security updates for Microsoft Office, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/wsus/default.aspx).
  
**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**
  
Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang=en).
  
The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.

<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>You can also click the <strong>Details</strong> tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
<li>Finally, you can also click the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.</li>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
<p>Supported Security Update Installation Switches</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Switch</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>/?</strong> or <strong>/help</strong></td>
<td>Displays usage dialog.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/passive</strong></td>
<td>Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/quiet</strong></td>
<td>Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/norestart</strong></td>
<td>Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/forcerestart</strong></td>
<td>Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/extract</strong></td>
<td>Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/extract:&lt;path&gt;</strong></td>
<td>Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/lang:&lt;LCID&gt;</strong></td>
<td>Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>/log:&lt;log file&gt;</strong></td>
<td>Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>This security update cannot be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in <strong>Start Search</strong>.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click on the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.</li>
<li>You may also click on the <strong>Details</strong> tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.</li>
<li>Finally, you may also click on the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.</li>
</ol>
