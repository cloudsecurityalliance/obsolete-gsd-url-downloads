<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-excel-could-allow-remote-code-execution-2293211">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2293211)</h2>
<p>Published: October 12, 2010</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves thirteen privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file or a specially crafted Lotus 1-2-3 file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Excel 2002, Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Excel 2007, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; and all supported versions of Microsoft Office Excel Viewer and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing the way that Microsoft Office Excel parses specially crafted Excel files and specially crafted Lotus 1-2-3 files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2293211" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2293211</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
Refer to the reference tables in the <strong>Security Update Deployment</strong> section for the location of the file information details.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this update only Important for all affected versions of Excel?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Excel 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.</p>
<p><strong>What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?</strong><br/>
The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>MS10-079 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How does MS10-079 relate to this bulletin (MS10-080)?</strong><br/>
The security update packages in this bulletin, MS10-080, for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2422343), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB2422352), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB2422398) also address the vulnerabilities described in MS10-079. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, or Open XML File Format Converter for Mac installed will only need to install these security update packages once.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Excel is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft Excel that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Microsoft Excel Viewer?</strong><br/>
The Microsoft Excel Viewer is a replacement for all previous Excel Viewer versions, including Excel Viewer 97 and Excel Viewer 2003. With Excel Viewer, you can open, view, and print Excel workbooks, even if you don't have Excel installed. You can also copy data from Excel Viewer to another program. However, you cannot edit data, save a workbook, or create a new workbook.</p>
<p><strong>The Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component.</strong> <strong>Will I be offered</strong> <strong>this update?</strong><br/>
Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.</p>
<p><strong>Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?</strong><br/>
No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.</p>

<h2 id="excel-record-parsing-integer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3230">Excel Record Parsing Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3230</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-3230" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-3230</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-excel-record-parsing-integer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3230">Mitigating Factors for Excel Record Parsing Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3230</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-excel-record-parsing-integer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3230">Workarounds for Excel Record Parsing Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3230</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Do not open Microsoft Office files from untrusted sources</strong></p>
<p>Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="faq-for-excel-record-parsing-integer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3230">FAQ for Excel Record Parsing Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3230</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When Microsoft Excel validates record information upon opening a specially crafted Excel file, a memory handling error may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When Microsoft Excel validates record information upon opening a specially crafted Excel file, a memory handling error may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates record information.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When Microsoft Excel validates record information upon opening a specially crafted Excel file, a memory handling error may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Excel file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates record information.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was</strong> <strong>being exploited?</strong><br/>

<h2 id="real-time-data-array-record-vulnerability---cve-2010-3240">Real Time Data Array Record Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3240</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-3240" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-3240</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-real-time-data-array-record-vulnerability---cve-2010-3240">Mitigating Factors for Real Time Data Array Record Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3240</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-real-time-data-array-record-vulnerability---cve-2010-3240">Workarounds for Real Time Data Array Record Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3240</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>For Office 2007</strong> </p>
<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with the 2007 Microsoft Office system, all of the latest security updates for the 2007 Microsoft Office system must be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special &quot;exempt directory&quot; as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2007.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong></p>
<p>For Office 2007</p>
<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]

&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now</a></p>
<p>MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:</p>
<p><a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" data-linktype="external">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us</a></p>
<p><strong>Enable MOICE</strong></p>

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Microsoft Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and** **Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch                    | Description                                                                                                         |  
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?** or **/help**       | Displays usage dialog.                                                                                              |  
| **/passive**              | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel.           |  
| **/quiet**                | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/norestart**            | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart.                                                  |  
| **/forcerestart**         | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |  
| **/extract**              | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder.                                   |  
| **/extract:&lt;path&gt;** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/lang:&lt;LCID&gt;**    | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language.                              |  
| **/log:&lt;log file&gt;** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation.                                        |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search**box.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
