<h2 id="cumulative-security-update-for-internet-explorer-867801">Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (867801)</h2>
<p>Published: July 30, 2004 | Updated: August 01, 2004</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.0</p>
<p><strong>Issued:</strong> July 30, 2004<br/>
<strong>Updated:</strong> August 1, 2004<br/>
<strong>Version:</strong> 2.0</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p><strong>Who should read this document:</strong> Customers who use Microsoft® Internet Explorer</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Vulnerability:</strong>  Remote Code Execution</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Severity Rating:</strong> Critical</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Customers should apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Security Update Replacement:</strong> This update replaces the one that is provided in Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-004" data-linktype="external">MS04-004</a>, which is itself a cumulative update.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> Subsequent to the release of this security bulletin, Microsoft was made aware that the update provided for Windows XP customers running the new version of Windows Update, Windows Update Version 5, did not contain the final release code for the vulnerabilities addressed in the security bulletin. Microsoft has corrected the update and is re-releasing this bulletin to advise of the availability of a revised update available to Windows Update Version 5 customers. Customers who are utilizing Windows Update Version 4, the vast majority of customers, are not affected by this revision.
This update does not include <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=824684" data-linktype="external">hotfixes</a> for Internet Explorer provided since the release of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-004" data-linktype="external">MS04-004</a>. Customers who have received hotfixes from Microsoft or their support providers since the release of <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-004" data-linktype="external">MS04-004</a> should review the FAQ section for this update to determine how this update might impact their operating systems.</p>

<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This update resolves several newly discovered public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own Vulnerability Details section.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140" data-linktype="external">assessment</a> is based on the types of systems that are affected by the vulnerability, their typical deployment patterns, and the effect that exploiting the vulnerability would have on them.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update</h2>
<p><strong>Why is this update being re-released?</strong><br/>
Subsequent to the release of MS04-025, Microsoft was made aware that the update provided for Windows XP customers running the new version of Windows Update, Windows Update Version 5, did not contain the proper fixes for the vulnerabilities discussed in the security bulletin. Microsoft has corrected the update and is re-releasing the bulletin to advise of the availability of the revised update. Customers who are running Windows Update Version 5 who have automatic updates enabled need take no action, as the revised update will be delivered automatically. Customers who manually utilize Windows Update and are running Windows Update Version 5 need to revisit the Windows Update site and download the revised update at <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com" data-linktype="external">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if I’m running Windows Update Version 5?</strong><br/>
Customers can verify if they are using Windows Update Version 5 by looking for the Express Install arrow on the Windows Update home page. If you see the “Express Install” arrow on the home page you have version 5 installed. If you see the “Express Install” arrow, click on the link and the new update will be offered to you. If you do not have an “Express Install” link in the Windows Update page, then you are not running version 5 and are not affected.</p>
<p><strong>What is Windows Update Version 5?</strong><br/>
Windows Update Version 5 is the newest version of the Windows Update service that began rolling out to customers this week. There are several enhancements in Windows Update Version 5 that will not only help users keep their PCs secure but will improve ease of use and discoverability of the site. The site now offers two easy-to-use installation options – Express and Custom -- to quickly find the updates that best meet a customer’s need. WU and AU are now both optimized for dial up and low bandwidth users. For instance, if a customer loses Internet connectivity, the download will pick up where it left off in the last download session. A new homepage design and navigation taxonomy also make Windows Update easier to navigate and provide better integration with related customer offerings such as Automatic Update.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not on Windows Update Version 5. How do I get it?</strong><br/>
If you’re on Windows XP and have Automatic Updates turned on, you will receive Windows Update Version 5 automatically in the next few weeks. If you don’t have Automatic Updates turned on, you will be upgraded to Windows Update Version 5 when you visit the Windows Update site after the initial rollout to users with Automatic Updates is complete. This is expected to take another few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>I use Software Update Services (SUS) to deploy my security updates. Do I need to re-deploy this update?</strong><br/>
No. While SUS does leverage Windows Update technology to help deploy security updates, SUS does not use Windows Update Version 5 and is not impacted by this re-release.</p>
<p><strong>I use Systems Management Services (SMS)to deploy my security updates. Do I need to re-deploy this update?</strong><br/>
<strong>No.</strong> This problem specifically affects Windows Update Version 5 and does not affect customers using SMS at all.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers can install only this update.</p>
<p><strong>What updates does this release replace?</strong><br/>
This is a cumulative update that includes the functionality of all the previously released updates for Internet Explorer. The security bulletin ID and operating systems that are affected for the previous Internet Explorer update are listed in the following table.</p>

**I'm still using Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a or Windows 2000 Service Pack 2, but extended security update support ended on June 30, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for these operating system versions. Why is that?**  
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation Service Pack 6a and Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 have reached the end of their life cycles as previously documented, and Microsoft extended this support to June 30, 2004. However, the end-of-life for the extended support period occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before June 30, 2004. Therefore, we have decided to release security updates for these operating system versions as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting these operating system versions, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary.
  
It should be a priority for customers who have these operating system versions to migrate to supported versions to prevent potential exposure to future vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Life Cycle, visit the following [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these operating system versions, visit the following [Microsoft Product Support Services Web site](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;%5bln%5d;lifeanoct2003).

Vulnerability Details  
---------------------
<h4 id="navigation-method-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2004-0549">Navigation Method Cross-Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0549:</h4>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles navigation methods. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, this could allow the attacker to take complete control of an affected system.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-navigation-method-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2004-0549">Mitigating Factors for Navigation Method Cross-Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0549:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Customers who have installed both the update referenced in Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=30585" data-linktype="external">MS04-024</a> and have installed the ADODB.Stream update that is referenced in Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=870669" data-linktype="external">870669</a> will be at a reduced risk of this vulnerability resulting in remote code execution.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040" data-linktype="external">MS03-040</a> or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Use Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 or later and have applied the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> or a later Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express.</li>
<li>Use Microsoft Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update installed</li>
<li>Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later or Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in their default configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration that mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-navigation-method-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2004-0549">Workarounds for Navigation Method Cross-Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0549:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX control and Active scripting in the Internet zone and Local Intranet zone.</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and click <strong>Custom Level.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings,</strong> in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins,</strong> click <strong>Prompt.</strong></li>
<li>In the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong>to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. Microsoft recommends that you only add sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotes). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires the use of an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strengthen the security settings for the Local Machine zone in Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>Because this vulnerability permits an attacker to run HTML code in the Local Machine security zone, users can reduce the impact of this vulnerability by restricting the default settings in this zone. For more information about these settings, and for more information about the potential impacts of changing these default settings, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;833633" data-linktype="external">833633</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers consider these changes to Internet Explorer security settings as a last resort only. If you make these changes, you may lose some functionality for some Windows programs and components. Before you make these changes in a production environment, test the changes extensively to verify that mission-critical programs continue to work correctly for all users.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Install</strong> <strong>Outlook E-mail Security Update</strong> <strong>if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.</strong></p>
<p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed.</p>
<p>Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Install Microsoft Security Bulletin</strong> <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external"><strong>MS04-018</strong></a> <strong>if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.</strong></p>
<p>Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed.</p>
<p>Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.</p>
<p>Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594" data-linktype="external">307594</a>.</p>
<p>For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387" data-linktype="external">291387</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.</li>
<li>Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.</li>
<li>Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="faq-for-navigation-method-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2004-0549">FAQ for Navigation Method Cross-Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0549:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs, view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The process by which Navigation Methods are validated by the Internet Explorer cross-domain security model.</p>
<p><strong>What is the cross domain security model that Internet Explorer implements?</strong><br/>
One of the principal security functions of a browser is to make sure that browser windows that are under the control of different Web sites cannot interfere with each other or access each other's data, while allowing windows from the same site to interact with each other. To differentiate between cooperative and uncooperative browser windows, the concept of a &quot;domain&quot; has been created. A domain is a security boundary - any open windows within the same domain can interact with each other, but windows from different domains cannot. The cross-domain security model is the part of the security architecture that keeps windows from different domains from interfering with each other.</p>
<p>The simplest example of a domain is associated with Web sites. If you visit <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a>, and it opens a window to <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com/security" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com/security</a>, the two windows can interact with each other because both sites belong to the same domain, <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a>. However, if you visited <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a>, and it opened a window to a different Web site, the cross-domain security model would protect the two windows from each other. The concept goes even further. The file system on your local computer is also a domain. For example, <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a> could open a window and show you a file on your hard disk. However, because your local file system is in a different domain from the Web site, the cross-domain security model should prevent the Web site from reading the file that is being displayed.</p>
<p>The Internet Explorer cross-domain security model can be configured by using the security zone settings in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>What are Internet Explorer security zones?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360" data-linktype="external">security zones</a> are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones that are based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is placed in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then enticing the user to visit this page or to view the HTML e-mail message. When the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other websites, local files on the system, or cause script to run in the security context of the Local Machine Zone.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability. Critical security updates for these platforms may not be available concurrently with the other security updates provided as part of this security bulletin. They will be made available as soon as possible following the release. When these security updates are available, you will be able to download them only from the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130" data-linktype="external">Windows Update Web site</a>. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration that mitigates this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?</strong></p>
<p>Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying numerous security-related settings, including the settings on the <strong>Security</strong> and the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box. Some of the important modifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), HTML content, and file downloads.</li>
<li>Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.</li>
<li>Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.</li>
<li>Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.</li>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142" data-linktype="external">denial of service</a> vulnerability, but it is also potential remote code execution vulnerability. If the user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability to allow code execution could gain complete control over an affected system and could then install programs; view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts that have full privileges Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p><strong>What is a double free condition?</strong><br/>
An attacker could cause an affected system, while processing a specially crafted GIF file, to try to release or “free” memory that may have already been set aside for use. Releasing memory that has already been freed could lead to memory corruption. An attacker could add arbitrary code to memory that is then executed when the corruption occurs. If the user is logged on with administrative privileges, this code could then be executed at a system level of privilege.</p>
<p>Typically, this vulnerability will cause a denial of service to occur. However, on a limited basis, code execution could occur. Because of the unique layout of the memory on each affected system, exploiting this vulnerability on a mass scale could potentially be difficult.</p>

<p>/<strong>Q</strong> Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.</p>
<p>/<strong>Q:U</strong> Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.</p>
<p>/<strong>Q:A</strong> Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.</p>
<p>/<strong>T</strong>: <strong>&lt;full path&gt;</strong> Specifies the target folder for extracting files.</p>
<p>/<strong>C</strong> Extracts the files without installing them. If /<strong>T</strong>: path is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.</p>
<p>/<strong>C</strong>: <strong>&lt;Cmd&gt;</strong> Override Install Command defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup .inf or .exe file.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:N</strong> Never restarts the computer after installation.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:I</strong> Prompts the user to restart the computer if a restart is required, except when used with <strong>/Q:A</strong>.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:A</strong> Always restarts the computer after installation.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:S</strong> Restarts the computer after installation without prompting the user.</p>
<p>/<strong>N:V</strong> No version checking - Install the program over any previous version.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> These switches do not necessarily work with all updates. If a switch is not available, then that functionality is necessary for the correct installation of the update. Also, the use of the /N:V switch is unsupported and may result in an unbootable system. If the installation is unsuccessful, you should consult your support professional to understand why it failed to install.</p>
<p>For additional information about the supported setup switches, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;197147" data-linktype="external">197147</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Verifying Update Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Search Results pane</strong>, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>All or part of the file name box</strong>, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{2298d453-bcae-4519-bf33-1cbf3faf1524}</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Confirm that the <strong>IsInstalled</strong> DWORD value with a data value of 1 appears in the registry key.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Version Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Confirm that <strong>Q867801</strong> is listed in the <strong>Update Versions</strong> field in the <strong>About Internet Explorer</strong> dialog box</p>
<h4 id="internet-explorer-501-for-windows-2000-all-versions">Internet Explorer 5.01 for Windows 2000 (all versions)</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br/>
To install the Internet Explorer 5.01 version of this update, you must be running one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 2 (version 5.00.3315.1000) on Windows 2000 SP2</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3 (version 5.00.3502.1000) on Windows 2000 SP3</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 (version 5.00.3700.1000) on Windows 2000 SP4</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Versions of Windows and versions of Internet Explorer that are not listed in this article are no longer supported. Although you can install some of the update packages that are described in this article on these versions of Windows and of Internet Explorer, Microsoft has not tested these versions to assess whether they are affected by these vulnerabilities or to confirm that the update that this bulletin describes addresses these vulnerabilities. Microsoft recommends that you upgrade to a supported version of Windows and of Internet Explorer, and then apply the appropriate update.</p>
<p>For more information about support lifecycles for Windows components, see the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>
<p>The security update supports the following setup switches:</p>
<p>/<strong>Q</strong> Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.</p>
<p>/<strong>Q:U</strong> Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.</p>
<p>/<strong>Q:A</strong> Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.</p>
<p>/<strong>T</strong>: <strong>&lt;full path&gt;</strong> Specifies the target folder for extracting files.</p>
<p>/<strong>C</strong> Extracts the files without installing them. If /<strong>T</strong>: path is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.</p>
<p>/<strong>C</strong>: <strong>&lt;Cmd&gt;</strong> Override Install Command defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup .inf or .exe file.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:N</strong> Never restarts the computer after installation.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:I</strong> Prompts the user to restart the computer if a restart is required, except when used with <strong>/Q:A</strong>.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:A</strong> Always restarts the computer after installation.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:S</strong> Restarts the computer after installation without prompting the user.</p>
<p>/<strong>N:V</strong> No version checking - Install the program over any previous version.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> These switches do not necessarily work with all updates. If a switch is not available, then that functionality is necessary for the correct installation of the update. Also, the use of the /N:V switch is unsupported and may result in an unbootable system. If the installation is unsuccessful, you should consult your support professional to understand why it failed to install.</p>
<p>For additional information about the supported setup switches, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;197147" data-linktype="external">197147</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment Information</strong></p>
<p>For example, for the Internet Explorer 5.01 SP2 update, to install the update without any user intervention and not force the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt:</p>
<p><strong>IE5.01SP2-KB867801-Windows2000SP2x86-ENU.exe /q:a /r:n</strong></p>
<p>For information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21125" data-linktype="external">Software Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Restart Requirement</strong></p>
<p>You must restart your system after you apply this security update.</p>
<p>To remove this update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. Click <strong>Internet Explorer 867801</strong>, and then click <strong>Change/Remove</strong> (or click <strong>Add/Remove</strong>).</p>
<p>System administrators can use the Ieuninst.exe utility to remove this update. This security update installs the Ieuninst.exe utility in the %Windir% folder. This utility supports the following setup switches:</p>
<p>/<strong>?</strong>: Show the list of supported switches</p>
<p>/<strong>z</strong>: Do not restart when the installation is complete</p>
<p>/<strong>q</strong>: Use Quiet mode (no user interaction)</p>
<p>For example, to remove this update quietly, use the following command:</p>
<p><strong>c:\windows\ieuninst /q c:\windows\inf\q867801.inf</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This command assumes that Windows is installed in the C:\Windows folder.</p>
<p><strong>File Information</strong></p>
<p>The English version of this update has the file attributes (or later) that are listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use the <strong>Time Zone</strong> tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.</p>
