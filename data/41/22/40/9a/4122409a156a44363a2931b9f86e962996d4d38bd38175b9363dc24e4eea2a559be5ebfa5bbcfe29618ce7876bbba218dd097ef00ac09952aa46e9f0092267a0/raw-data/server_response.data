                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION 
   
    1. CVE-2014-0224
	OpenSSL could allow a Man-in-the-middle(MITM) attacker to force the use of 
	weak keying material in OpenSSL SSL/TLS clients and servers. The attacker 
	can decrypt and modify traffic from the attacked client and server. The 
	attack can only be performed between a vulnerable client *and* server.

    2. CVE-2014-0221
	OpenSSL could allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service information.
	The attacker can send a invalid DTLS handshake to an OpenSSL DTLS client,
	resulting recursive execution of code and eventual crash.

    3. CVE-2014-0195
	OpenSSL could allow an attacker to cause a "buffer overrun" situation. This 
	is triggered when an attacker sends an invalid DTLS fragments to an OpenSSL 
	DTLS client or server, and thus forcing it to run arbitrary code on a 
	vulnerable client or server.

    4. CVE-2014-0198
	OpenSSL could allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service information.
	The attacker will be able to exploit the flaw in the do_ssl3_write function
	via a NULL pointer dereference.

    5. CVE-2014-3470
	OpenSSL could allow an attacker to cause Denial of Service information.
	The attacker will be able to exploit the software's anonymous ECDH cipher 
	suites present within OpenSSL clients.

III. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

        To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following
        command:

        lslpp -L openssl.base
 
        The following fileset levels are vulnerable:
 
    A. CVE-2014-0198

        AIX Fileset      Lower Level  Upper Level   KEY
        --------------------------------------------------------
        openssl.base     1.0.1.500    1.0.1.510    key_w_fs

    B. CVE-2014-0224, CVE-2014-0221, CVE-2014-0195, CVE-2014-3470

        AIX Fileset      Lower Level  Upper Level   KEY
        --------------------------------------------------------
        openssl.base     1.0.1.500     1.0.1.510      key_w_fs
        openssl.base     0.9.8.401     0.9.8.2501     key_w_fs
        openssl.base     12.9.8.1100   12.9.8.2501    key_w_fs


IV. SOLUTIONS

    A fix is available, and it can be downloaded from:

    https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=aixbp

    To extract the fixes from the tar file:

    For Openssl 1.0.1 version - 
        zcat openssl-1.0.1.511.tar.Z | tar xvf -
    For Openssl 0.9.8 version - 
        zcat openssl-0.9.8.2502.tar.Z | tar xvf -
    For Openssl 12.9.8 version - 
        zcat openssl-12.9.8.2502.tar.Z | tar xvf -

    IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
    of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
    readable before proceeding.

    To preview the fix installation:

    installp -apYd . openssl

    To install the fix package:

    installp -aXYd . openssl
    

V. WORKAROUNDS
 
    No workarounds.
