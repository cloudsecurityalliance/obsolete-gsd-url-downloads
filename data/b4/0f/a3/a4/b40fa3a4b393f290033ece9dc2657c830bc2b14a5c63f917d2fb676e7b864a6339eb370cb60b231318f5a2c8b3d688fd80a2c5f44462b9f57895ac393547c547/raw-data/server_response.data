<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-excel-could-allow-remote-code-execution-949029">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Excel Could Allow Remote Code Execution (949029)</h2>
<p>Published: March 11, 2008 | Updated: October 01, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 3.3</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves several privately reported and publicly reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Excel that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Excel file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft Office Excel 2000 Service Pack 3 and rated Important for Excel 2002 Service Pack 3, Excel 2003 Service Pack 2, Excel Viewer 2003, Excel 2007, Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, Office 2004 for Mac, and Office 2008 for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>This security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel performs validations when opening Excel files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information.</strong></p>
<p>This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/947563" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 947563</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949029" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949029</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.</p>

For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>I do not have any products in the Affected Software table installed on my system, but the affected software was included in the Microsoft Office suite from which I installed other Office components. Why am I being offered the security update?</strong> 
The vulnerabilities described in this security update exist within Microsoft Office but could not be exploited using applications not listed in the Affected Software table. However, some non-affected Microsoft Office applications use some of the same files as the applications listed in the Affected Software table that the security update does affect. In some cases, detection of these shared files will cause the update to be offered even if none of the applications listed in the Affected Software table are present. These shared files do not constitute a vulnerability, but we do recommend installing the security update to prevent it from being offered again.</p>
<p><strong>I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?</strong> 
Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3</a>. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why did Microsoft re-release this bulletin on March 19, 2008?</strong> 
This bulletin has been re-released to re-offer the security update to users of Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3. The security update previously had a known issue in Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3. The problem caused Excel calculations to return an incorrect result when a Real Time Data source is used in a user-defined Visual Basic for Applications function. For more information on this issue, including how to determine which version of the update you have installed, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950340" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 950340</a>. Automatic Updates will correctly offer this update to users of Microsoft Office Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3, whether or not they have applied the original MS08-014.</p>
<p><strong>What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?</strong> 
Microsoft is aware of a problem with the initial release of this update that may affect users of Microsoft Excel 2003 Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3. The problem causes Excel calculations to return an incorrect result when a Real Time Data source is used in a user-defined Visual Basic for Applications function. If you have applications that leverage Real Time Data sources in Visual Basic for Applications functions, we recommend that you perform additional testing before initiating a wide deployment of the update. The investigation on this has been completed and we have issued a re-release of the bulletin on 3/19/2008 to address the problem in the affected versions of Microsoft Excel. For more information on this issue, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950340" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 950340</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. Why am I still being offered this update?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 is not impacted by the security vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin. However, users will still be offered this update because the update files for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that are currently on your system. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.</p>
<p><strong>I use 2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 1. Why am I still being offered this update?</strong><br/>
2007 Microsoft Office System Service Pack 1 is not impacted by the security vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin. However, users will still be offered this update because the update files for 2007 Microsoft Office Service Pack 1 are newer (with higher version numbers) than the files that currently on your system. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.</p>
<p><strong>Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute a flaw in the Microsoft update mechanism?</strong><br/>
No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.</p>
<p><strong>What is included in the Microsoft Office update that causes the higher version of the update files?</strong><br/>
The update files include changes to support stability changes in Microsoft Office and additional changes to support corporate environment changes. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to their environment and configurations of their systems.</p>

<h2 id="excel-data-validation-record-vulnerability--cve-2008-0111">Excel Data Validation Record Vulnerability – CVE-2008-0111</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Excel processes data validation records when loading Excel files into memory. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed file which could be hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site, or included as an e-mail attachment.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-0111" data-linktype="external">CVE-2008-0111</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-excel-data-validation-record-vulnerability--cve-2008-0111">Mitigating Factors for Excel Data Validation Record Vulnerability – CVE-2008-0111</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>Users who have installed and are using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f" data-linktype="external">Office Document Open Confirmation Tool</a> for Office 2000 will be prompted with <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Save</strong>, or <strong>Cancel</strong> before opening a document.

<h4 id="workarounds-for-excel-data-validation-record-vulnerability--cve-2008-0111">Workarounds for Excel Data Validation Record Vulnerability – CVE-2008-0111</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>For Office 2003</strong></p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.</p>
<p><strong>How to Undo the Workaround:</strong></p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="faq-for-excel-style-record-vulnerability--cve-2008-0114">FAQ for Excel Style Record Vulnerability – CVE-2008-0114</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused by a memory handling error in Excel when validating Style record information upon opening a specially crafted Excel file. The error may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open a malformed Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates Style record information.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations.</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround</strong>: Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.</p>
<p><strong>How to Undo the Workaround:</strong></p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\Excel\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-macro-validation-vulnerability--cve-2008-0081">FAQ for Macro Validation Vulnerability – CVE-2008-0081</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Excel does not properly validate macro information when loading specially crafted Excel files.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open a malformed Excel file with an affected version of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted Excel file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Excel is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Excel validates macro information.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
Yes. This vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued. It has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-0081" data-linktype="external">CVE-2008-0081</a>. This vulnerability was first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/947563" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 947563</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
Yes. When this security bulletin was issued, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the “Microsoft baseline Security Analyzer” heading under the section, Microsoft Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Office, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
