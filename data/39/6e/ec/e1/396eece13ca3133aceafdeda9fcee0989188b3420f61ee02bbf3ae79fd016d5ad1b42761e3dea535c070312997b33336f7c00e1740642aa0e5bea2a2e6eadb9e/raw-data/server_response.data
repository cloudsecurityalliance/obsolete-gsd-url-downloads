<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-the-embedded-opentype-font-engine-could-allow-remote-code-execution-961371">Vulnerabilities in the Embedded OpenType Font Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution (961371)</h2>
<p>Published: July 14, 2009 | Updated: August 25, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 3.0</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in a Microsoft Windows component, the Embedded OpenType (EOT) Font Engine. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited either of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the Microsoft Windows EOT component parses files and content containing embedded fonts. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/961371" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 961371</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>

Embedded OpenType Font Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0231  
------------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Windows Embedded OpenType (EOT) font technology parses data records in specially crafted embedded fonts. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0231](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0231).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Embedded OpenType Font Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0231
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
#### Workarounds for Embedded OpenType Font Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0231
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable support for parsing embedded fonts in Internet Explorer**
  
    Disabling the support for the parsing of embedded fonts in Internet Explorer prevents this application from being used as an attack vector. However, additional attack vectors, such as embedded fonts within a Microsoft Office document, could still be exploited.
  
    **Using the Interactive Method**
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the Tools menu  
    2.  Click the **Security** tab  
    3.  Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**  
    4.  Scroll down to the **Downloads** section and select **Prompt** or **Disable** for the **Font Downloading** security setting  
    5.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer
  
    **Using Group Policy**
  
    **Note** The Group Policy MMC snap-in can be used to set policy for a machine, for an organizational unit or an entire domain. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Group Policy collection](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd1033.mspx?mfr=true)  
-   [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a31033.mspx?mfr=true)  
-   [Core Group Policy tools and settings](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc94911033.mspx?mfr=true)
  
    Perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open the Group Policy Management Console and configure it to work with the appropriate Group Policy object (e.g., local machine, OU or domain GPO).  
    2.  Navigate to the following node:  
        User Configuration - Windows Settings - Internet Explorer - Maintenance - Security  
    3.  Double-click **Security Zones and Content Rating.**

    5.  In the **Internet Properties** dialog box, ensure the **Internet** zone is selected and then press **Custom Level.**  
    6.  Scroll down to **Downloads** and set **Font Download** to **Prompt** or **Disable.**  
    7.  Press **OK** to return to the Internet Properties dialog box.  
    8.  Repeat these steps for the **Local Intranet** zone.  
    9.  Press **OK** three times to return to the Group Policy Management Console.  
    10. Refresh the Group Policy on all machines or wait for the next scheduled Group Policy refresh interval for the settings to take effect.
  
    **Using a Managed Deployment Script**
  
    This security setting can be manually entered into the registry by creating a registry script and importing it either by double-clicking it or running regedit.exe as part of a logon or machine startup script. For managed deployments Regedit.exe can be used to import a registry script silently with the '-s' switch. For more information on regedit command line switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 82821](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q82821/), "Registration Info Editor (REGEDIT) Command-Line Switches."
  
    To set this setting to 'Prompt' for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:
  
    `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone; 1604 is the Font download policy; dword:00000001 sets the policy to prompt[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]"1604"=dword:00000001; Zone 3 is the internet zone[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]"1604"=dword:00000001`
  
    To set this setting to 'Disable' for the Internet and Local Intranet Zones paste the following text into a .REG file and then import the .REG file on managed machines as part of your organization's managed deployment process:
  
    `Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00; Zone 1 is the local intranet zone; 1604 is the Font download policy; dword:00000003 sets the policy to disable[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\1]"1604"=dword:00000003; Zone 3 is the internet zone[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\3]"1604"=dword:00000003`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Web sites making use of embedded font technology will fail to display properly.
  
-   **Deny Access to T2EMBED.DLL**
  
    **On Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003:**
  
    For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
  
    `Echo y| cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N`
  
    For 64-bit systems, enter the following command from an administrative command prompt:
  
    `Echo y| cacls "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /E /P everyone:N`
  
    **On Windows** **Vista** **and Windows Server 2008:**
  
    For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
  
    `Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll"Icacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /save %TEMP%\t2embed_ACL.TXTIcacls.exe "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /deny everyone:(F)`
  
    For 64-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
  
    `Takeown.exe /f "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll"Icacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /save %TEMP%\t2embed_ACL.TXTIcacls.exe "%windir%\syswow64\t2embed.dll" /deny everyone:(F)`
  
    **Impact of workaround.** Applications that rely on embedded font technology will fail to display properly.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    **On Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003:**
  
    For 32-bit systems, enter the following command at an administrative command prompt:
  
    `cacls "%windir%\system32\t2embed.dll" /E /R everyone`

#### FAQ for Embedded OpenType Font Heap Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0231
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow when a Microsoft Windows component, the Embeded OpenType Font Engine, parses name tables within specially crafted files and content containing embedded fonts.
  
**What are Embedded OpenType (EOT) Fonts?**   
Embedded OpenType (EOT) fonts are a compact form of fonts designed for use on Web pages. These fonts can be embedded in a document. Use of EOT fonts ensures that a user views the document exactly as the author intended. The Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT) lets Web authors create font objects that are linked to their Web pages so that when viewed through the browser, pages display in the style contained in the font object. For more information, see MSDN article, [About Font Embedding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533034.aspx). All platforms listed in the Affected Software table support the rendering of EOT fonts by default.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
This vulnerability requires that a user view content rendered in a specially crafted EOT font.
  
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message with a Microsoft Word or PowerPoint file containing a specially crafted EOT font embedded in the document and convincing the user to open or preview the file.
  
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains specially crafted embedded fonts that are used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update addresses the issue by correcting the way that the Embedded OpenType Font Engine parses files and content containing embedded fonts.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for Embedded OpenType Font Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0232
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow when a Microsoft Windows component, the Embeded OpenType Font Engine, parses name tables within specially crafted files and content containing embedded fonts.
  
**What are Embedded OpenType (EOT) Fonts?**   
Embedded OpenType (EOT) fonts are a compact form of fonts designed for use on Web pages. These fonts can be embedded in a document. This ensures that a user views the document exactly as the author intended. The Web Embedding Fonts Tool (WEFT) lets Web authors create font objects that are linked to their Web pages so that when viewed through the browser, pages display in the style contained in the font object. For more information, see the MSDN article, [About Font Embedding](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533034.aspx). All platforms listed in the Affected Software table support the rendering of EOT fonts by default.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
This vulnerability requires that a user view content rendered in a specially crafted EOT font.
  
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message with a Microsoft Word or PowerPoint file containing a specially crafted EOT font attached and convincing the user to open or preview the file.
  
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains specially crafted content that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update addresses the issue by correcting the way that the Embedded OpenType Font Engine parses files and content containing embedded fonts.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**
  
Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang=en).
  
The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).
  
For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).
  
For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch            | Description                                                                                                                                |  
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches.                                                                                                       |  
| **/quiet**        | Suppresses the display of status or error messages.                                                                                        |  
| **/norestart**    | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |
  
**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**    
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**    
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
