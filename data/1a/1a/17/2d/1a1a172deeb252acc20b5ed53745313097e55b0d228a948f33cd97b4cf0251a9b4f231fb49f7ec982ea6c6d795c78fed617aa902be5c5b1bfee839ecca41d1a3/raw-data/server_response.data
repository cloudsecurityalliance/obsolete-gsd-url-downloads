<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-sharepoint-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-2695502">Vulnerabilities in SharePoint Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2695502)</h2>
<p>Published: July 10, 2012 | Updated: January 15, 2014</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.2</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves one publicly disclosed and five privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint and Windows SharePoint Services. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft InfoPath 2007, Microsoft InfoPath 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, and Microsoft Groove Server 2010; and for supported versions of Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 2.0, Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0, and SharePoint Foundation 2010. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that HTML strings are sanitized and by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>. For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating" data-linktype="external">Understanding Windows automatic updating</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2695502" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2695502</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

**How is this security update related to MS12-037 and MS12-039?**   
The HTML Sanitization Vulnerability (CVE-2012-1858) described in this bulletin also affects Internet Explorer and Microsoft Lync. However, you may install only the updates that correspond to the software you have installed on your systems. If you have installed Microsoft SharePoint, apply the required updates according to this bulletin. If you have installed Internet Explorer, apply the required updates according to [MS12-037](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=249045). If you have installed Microsoft Lync, apply the required updates according to [MS12-039](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=252488).
  
**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**   
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.
  
**Why are multiple update packages available for some affected software?**  
The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different updates packages as indicated in the **Affected Software** table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint Server software.
  
**There are multiple update packages available for some affected software. Do I need to install all of the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**   
Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.
  
For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, depending on their configuration of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, not all the server-package updates listed in this bulletin may apply. For more information on the applicability of these server-package updates in a SharePoint environment, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2695502](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2695502).
  
**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**   
No. Multiple updates for one version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft SharePoint Server software can be applied in any sequence.
  
**What is Microsoft Groove Server 2010?**   
Microsoft Groove Server 2010 provides comprehensive services for managing Microsoft SharePoint Workspace. Groove Server 2010 contains two components: Groove Server 2010 Manager and Groove Server 2010 Relay, each of which runs on a Windows server on an enterprise network.
  
**What is Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010?**   
[Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010](http://technet.microsoft.com/sharepoint/ee263910.aspx) is the new version of Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services. It is the essential solution for organizations that need a secure, manageable, Web-based collaboration platform. SharePoint helps teams stay connected and productive by providing easy access to the people, documents, and information that they need to make well-informed decisions and get work done. Use SharePoint Foundation to coordinate schedules, organize documents, and participate in discussions through team workspaces, blogs, wikis, and document libraries on the platform that is the underlying infrastructure for SharePoint Server.
  
**What is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0?**   
[Windows SharePoint Services 3.0](http://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/sharepoint/bb684453) provides a platform for collaborative applications, offering a common framework for document management and a common repository for storing documents of all types. It exposes key Windows Server services like Windows Workflow Services and Windows Rights Management Services.
  
Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 is provided as a free download for supported editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.
  
**How is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 related to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?**   
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server capabilities built on top of Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.
  
For systems with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 installed, you will need to apply the KB2596911 update for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. There is no configuration where you can only have Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and not Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.
  
**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

<h4 id="faq-for-html-sanitization-vulnerability---cve-2012-1858">FAQ for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2012-1858</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a site that is filtering HTML content via SafeHTML.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused by the way that HTML strings are sanitized.</p>
<p><strong>What is cross-site scripting?</strong>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a website. The vulnerability can affect web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the websites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify website content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks against users of a targeted site where HTML strings are sanitized. An attacker could then potentially run script on behalf of a victim user on the site.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target site that use HTML sanitization. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations the specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content.</p>
<p>For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted specially crafted script to a target site that use HTML sanitization, any webpage on that site that contains the specially crafted script is a potential vector for persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a webpage that contains the specially crafted script, the script could be run in the security context of the user.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where users connect to a site that sanitizes HTML strings, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that HTML strings are sanitized.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2012-1858" data-linktype="external">CVE-2012-1858</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later version be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft websites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

For more information about the supported installation switches, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs item in Control Panel.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs item in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>You can also click the <strong>Details</strong> tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
<li>Finally, you can also click the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.</li>

<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>You can also click the <strong>Details</strong> tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
<li>Finally, you can also click the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.</li>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later version be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft websites:

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later version be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft websites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)
