<h2 id="cumulative-security-update-of-activex-kill-bits-980195">Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits (980195)</h2>
<p>Published: June 08, 2010</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update addresses two privately reported vulnerabilities for Microsoft software. This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7, and Moderate for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page that instantiates a specific ActiveX control with Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. This update also includes kill bits for four third-party ActiveX controls.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by setting kill bits so that the vulnerable controls do not run in Internet Explorer. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsections under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> None</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>

<p><strong>What is a kill bit?</strong><br/>
A security feature in Microsoft Internet Explorer makes it possible to prevent an ActiveX control from ever being loaded by the Internet Explorer HTML-rendering engine. This is done by making a registry setting and is referred to as setting the kill bit. After the kill bit is set, the control can never be loaded, even when it is fully installed. Setting the kill bit makes sure that even if a vulnerable component is introduced or is re-introduced to a system, it remains inert and harmless.</p>
<p>For more information on kill bits, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>: How to stop an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>What is a security update of ActiveX kill bits?</strong><br/>
A security update of ActiveX kill bits contains the class IDs (CLSID) of certain ActiveX controls that are the basis of the security update. This security bulletin lists these CLSIDs in the <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong> section.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update not contain any binary files?</strong><br/>
This update only makes changes to the registry to disable the controls from instantiating in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>Should I install this update if I do not have the affected component installed or use the affected platform?</strong><br/>
Yes. Installing this update will block the vulnerable control from running in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to reapply this update if I install an ActiveX control discussed in this security update at a later date?</strong><br/>
No, reapplying this update is not required. The kill bit will block Internet Explorer from running the control even if the control is installed at a later date.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any kill bits that are not Microsoft-specific?</strong><br/>
Yes. Microsoft has been requested by organizations to set the kill bit for controls that the organizations own and have found to be vulnerable. See the subsection, &quot;Third-Party Kill Bits,&quot; in the <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong> section.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain kill bits that were previously shipped in a Microsoft Security Update?</strong><br/>
This update sets the kill bits for the Outlook View Controls ActiveX control previously addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=160633" data-linktype="external">MS09-060</a>.</p>
<p>For more information regarding this ActiveX control and how it may be updated, review the Microsoft security bulletin, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=160633" data-linktype="external">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) ActiveX Controls for Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (973965)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain kill bits that were previously shipped in an Internet Explorer security update?</strong><br/>
No, this update does not include kill bits that were previously shipped in an Internet Explorer security update. We recommend that you install the latest Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this security update have different severity levels for different Windows operating systems?</strong><br/>
This update has different severity levels because different mitigations apply to the vulnerability depending on the operating system. One such mitigation is that Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>

Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0252  
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0252](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-0252).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0252
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of exploitation of vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   A malicious Web site cannot exploit this vulnerability on systems where Microsoft Data Analyzer is not already installed. Microsoft Data Analyzer is not installed in Microsoft Office systems by default.
  
#### Workarounds for Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0252
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Enable or disable ActiveX Controls in Office 2007**
  
    To reduce the possibility of this vulnerability being exploited through an Office 2007 document using an ActiveX control, follow the steps below to disable ActiveX controls within Office documents. For more information about disabling ActiveX controls in Office 2007, see the Microsoft Office Online article, [Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office documents](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/ha100310671033.aspx).
  
    Open the Trust Center in Office 2007 applications using one of the following methods. Once you have selected the **ActiveX Settings**, select **Disable all controls without notification**, and then click **OK**.
  
    **Note** If you change an ActiveX control setting in one Office application, the settings are also changed in all the other Office programs on your computer.
  
    **Excel**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Excel Options**, select **TrustCenter**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Outlook**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **TrustCenter**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **PowerPoint**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **PowerPoint Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Word**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Word Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **TrustCenter Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Access**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Access Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **InfoPath**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Publisher**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Visio**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** ActiveX controls will not be instantiated in Microsoft Office applications.
  
-   **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**
  
    You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
  
    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
  
    For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow the steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the ActiveX objects are contained are documented under "What does the update do?" in the **FAQ for Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0252** section. Replace {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} below with the Class Identifiers found in that section.
  
    To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
    \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}\]  
    "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400  
    \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}\]  
    "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
  
    You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
    -   [Group Policy collection](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd1033.mspx?mfr=true)  
    -   [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a31033.mspx?mfr=true)  
    -   [Core Group Policy tools and settings](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc94911033.mspx?mfr=true)
  
    **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
  
    **Impact of Workaround**. There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Delete the registry keys previously added in implementing this workaround.
  
-   **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**
  
    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
  
    To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:
  
    1.  On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.  
    2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.  
    3.  Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.
  
    **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.
  
    **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** In **Internet Options**, return the slider to your previous setting or click **Reset all zones to default level**.
  
    **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**
  
    After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
  
    To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.  
    2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.  
    3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.  
    4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.  
    5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.  
    6.  Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
  
-   **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**
  
    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.  
    2.  Click the **Security** tab.  
    3.  Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.  
    4.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.  
    5.  Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.  
    6.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.  
    7.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** In **Security Settings**, return to your previous settings or else click **Reset**.
  
    **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**
  
    After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
  
    To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.  
    2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.  
    3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.  
    4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.  
    5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  
    6.Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
  
#### FAQ for Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0252
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**  
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
  
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**  
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**  
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
  
**What is the component affected by the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability affects the Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX control.
  
**Is this control installed by default in Microsoft Office?**   
No, this control requires manual installation by the user separate from the Office installation. It cannot be hosted and instantiated by a Web site without previously being installed on the user's system.
  
**What is the Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX control?**  
The Microsoft Data Analyzer ActiveX control allows programmatic control of the Data Analyzer from COM-based development applications such as Microsoft Visual Basic. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Exploring Microsoft Data Analyzer Programmability](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa155447(office.10).aspx).

Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 Developer Tools Vulnerability- CVE-2010-0811  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 Developer Tools. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-0811](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-0811).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 Developer Tools Vulnerability- CVE-2010-0811
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of exploitation of vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
#### Workarounds for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 Developer Tools Vulnerability- CVE-2010-0811
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Enable or disable ActiveX Controls in Office 2007**
  
    To reduce the possibility of this vulnerability being exploited through an Office 2007 document using an ActiveX control, follow the steps below to disable ActiveX controls within Office documents. For more information about disabling ActiveX controls in Office 2007, see the Microsoft Office Online article, [Enable or disable ActiveX controls in Office documents](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/ha100310671033.aspx).
  
    Open the Trust Center in Office 2007 applications using one of the following methods. Once you have selected the **ActiveX Settings**, select **Disable all controls without notification**, and then click **OK**.
  
    **Note** If you change an ActiveX control setting in one Office application, the settings are also changed in all the other Office programs on your computer.
  
    **Excel**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Excel Options**, select **TrustCenter**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Outlook**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **TrustCenter**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **PowerPoint**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **PowerPoint Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Word**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Word Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **TrustCenter Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Access**
  
    Click the **Microsoft Office** button, select **Access Options**, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **InfoPath**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Publisher**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Visio**
  
    From the **Tools** menu, select **Trust Center**, select **Trust Center Settings**, and then select **ActiveX Settings**.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** ActiveX controls will not be instantiated in Microsoft Office applications.
  
-   **Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer**
  
    You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
  
    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
  
    For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow the steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the ActiveX objects are contained are documented under "What does the update do?" in the **FAQ for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 Developer Tools Vulnerability - CVE-2010-0811** section. Replace {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} below with the Class Identifiers found in that section.
  
    To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00  
    \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}\]  
    "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400  
    \[HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ActiveX Compatibility\\{XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX}\]  
    "Compatibility Flags"=dword:00000400
  
    You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
    -   [Group Policy collection](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd1033.mspx?mfr=true)  
    -   [What is Group Policy Object Editor?](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a31033.mspx?mfr=true)  
    -   [Core Group Policy tools and settings](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc94911033.mspx?mfr=true)
  
    **Note** You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.
  
    **Impact of Workaround**. There is no impact as long as the object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** Delete the registry keys previously added in implementing this workaround.
  
-   **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**
  
    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.
  
    To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:
  
    1.  On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.  
    2.  In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.  
    3.  Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.
  
    **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.
  
    **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** In **Internet Options**, return the slider to your previous setting or click **Reset all zones to default level**.
  
    **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**
  
    After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
  
    To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.  
    2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.  
    3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.  
    4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.  
    5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.  
    6.  Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
  
-   **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**
  
    You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.  
    2.  Click the **Security** tab.  
    3.  Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.  
    4.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt **or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.  
    5.  Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.  
    6.  Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt **or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.  
    7.  Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.
  
    **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".
  
    **How to undo the workaround.** In **Security Settings**, return to your previous settings or else click **Reset**.
  
    **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**
  
    After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.
  
    To do this, follow these steps:
  
    1.  In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.  
    2.  In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.  
    3.  If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.  
    4.  In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.  
    5.  Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  
    6.Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.
  
    **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
  
#### FAQ for Microsoft Internet Explorer 8 Developer Tools Vulnerability- CVE-2010-0811
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**  
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
  
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**  
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**  
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked "safe for initialization" in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering engine. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
