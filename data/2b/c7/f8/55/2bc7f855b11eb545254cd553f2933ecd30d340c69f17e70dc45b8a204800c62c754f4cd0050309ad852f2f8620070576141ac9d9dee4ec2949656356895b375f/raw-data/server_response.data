                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. OVERVIEW

    The rmsock and rmsock64 commands do not create secure log files.
    A local attacker may exploit this error to append data to any file
    on the system because the command is setuid root.

    The following files are vulnerable:

    /usr/sbin/rmsock
    /usr/sbin/rmsock64

II. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

    To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following
    command:

    lslpp -L bos.net.tcp.client

    The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

    AIX Fileset           Lower Level       Upper Level
    ---------------------------------------------------
    bos.net.tcp.client    5.2.0.0           5.2.0.112
    bos.net.tcp.client    5.3.0.0           5.3.0.72
    bos.net.tcp.client    5.3.7.0           5.3.7.7
    bos.net.tcp.client    5.3.8.0           5.3.8.6
    bos.net.tcp.client    5.3.9.0           5.3.9.2
    bos.net.tcp.client    6.1.0.0           6.1.0.7
    bos.net.tcp.client    6.1.1.0           6.1.1.3
    bos.net.tcp.client    6.1.2.0           6.1.2.2

        By subscribing, you will receive periodic email alerting you
        to the status of the APAR, and a link to download the fix once
        it becomes available.

    B. FIXES

        Fixes are now available.  The fixes can be downloaded from:

        http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/rmsock_fix.tar
        ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/rmsock_fix.tar

        The links above are to a tar file containing this signed
        advisory, fix packages, and PGP signatures for each package.
        The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will
        enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX
        Technology Levels.

        AIX Level         Fix
        ----------------------------------------------------
        All               rmsock.090129.epkg.Z

        To extract the fixes from the tar file:

        tar xvf rmsock_fix.tar
        cd rmsock_fix

        Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

        The checksums below were generated using the "sum", "cksum",
        "csum -h MD5" (md5sum), and "csum -h SHA1" (sha1sum) commands
        and are as follows:

        sum         filename
        ------------------------------------
        25726     2 rmsock.090129.epkg.Z

        cksum           filename
        -------------------------------------------
        3705381579 2048 rmsock.090129.epkg.Z

        csum -h MD5 (md5sum)              filename
        ----------------------------------------------------------
        e805476887aa51022f8e8baf51a33988  rmsock.090129.epkg.Z

        csum -h SHA1 (sha1sum)                    filename
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        ea6944eea6e9d7b2d1a4d198f5759e365e5ed88c  rmsock.090129.epkg.Z

        To verify the sums, use the text of this advisory as input to
        csum, md5sum, or sha1sum. For example:

        csum -h SHA1 -i Advisory.asc
        md5sum -c Advisory.asc
        sha1sum -c Advisory.asc

        These sums should match exactly. The PGP signatures in the tar
        file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the
        integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be
        confirmed, contact IBM AIX Security and describe the
        discrepancy at the following address:

            security-alert@austin.ibm.com

     C. INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION

        IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
        of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
        readable before proceeding.

        Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression
        testing but not the full regression testing that takes place
        for Service Packs; thus, IBM does not warrant the fully
        correct functionality of an interim fix.

        Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

        http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html

        To preview an interim fix installation:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -p         # where ipkg_name is the name of the  
                                     # interim fix package being previewed.

        To install an interim fix package:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -X         # where ipkg_name is the name of the  
                                     # interim fix package being installed.


IV. WORKAROUNDS

    There are two workarounds available.

    A. OPTION 1

        Change the permissions of these commands to remove the setuid
        bit using the following commands:

        chmod 500 /usr/sbin/rmsock
        chmod 500 /usr/sbin/rmsock64

        NOTE: chmod will disable functionality of these commands for
        all users except root.

    B. OPTION 2 (AIX 5.3 and 6.1)

        Use the File Permissions Manager (fpm) command to manage
        setuid and setgid programs.

        fpm documentation can be found in the AIX 6 Security Redbook
        at:

        http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg247430.html

        An fpm level of high, medium, or low will remove the setuid
        bit from the affected commands.  For example:

        fpm -l high -p    # to preview changes
        fpm -l high       # to execute changes

        NOTE: Please review the documentation before execution.  fpm
        will disable functionality of multiple commands for all users
        except root.

V. OBTAINING FIXES

    AIX security fixes can be downloaded from:
