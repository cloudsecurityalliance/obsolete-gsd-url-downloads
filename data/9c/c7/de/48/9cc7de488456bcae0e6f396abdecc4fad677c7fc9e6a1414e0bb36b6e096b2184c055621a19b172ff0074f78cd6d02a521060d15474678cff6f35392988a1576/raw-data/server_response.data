<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This update resolves several newly discovered, privately and publicly reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own subsection in the &quot;Vulnerability Details&quot; section of this bulletin.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.</p>

#### FAQ for Word Macro Vulnerability – CVE-2007-0208:
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**  
The vulnerability results because Word incorrectly checks properties in a modified document, causing it to not prompt the user with a macro security warning when macros are present in the document.
  
**What is a Macro?**  
Generally, the term macro refers to a small program that automates frequently-performed tasks in an operating system or in a program. For example, all members of the Office family of products support the use of macros. This allows companies to develop macros that perform as sophisticated productivity tools that run in Word, in Excel, or in other programs. Like any computer program, macros can be misused. Malicious software may be written as macros and then embedded in Office documents. To mitigate this threat, Office has a security model that is designed to make sure that macros can only run when the user wants them to run. By using this vulnerability, an attacker might be able to run a macro without warning the user that a macro is present in the document.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.
  
**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**  
An attacker could seek to exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially-crafted Word document that contained a malicious macro. The attacker could then send it to a user, typically through an e-mail message, and then persuade the user to open the document. As a result, if the user were attacked by means of this vulnerability, the user's macro security level could be reduced and other macros that would otherwise be stopped by Word could be allowed to run. An attacker could also host the specially-crafted Word document on a network share or on a Web site; however, the attacker would still need to persuade the user to open the document.
  
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
  
**What does the update do?**  
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Word performs certain macro security controls when it opens a document.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**  
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**  
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### FAQ for Word Malformed Function Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0515:
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability when Word parses a file and processes a malformed function. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious web site. Viewing or previewing a malformed e-mail message in an affected version of Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.
  
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**  
Word does not perform sufficient data validation when processing the contents of a file. When Word opens a specially crafted Word file and parses a malformed function, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**  
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.
  
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.
  
**What does the update do?**  
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Word handles certain strings.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for commonly misconfigured security parameters. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
**Note** Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.      
    **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system, language, or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.      
    **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  
#### Word 2004 for Mac
  
**Installation Information:**
  
1.  Quit any applications that are running, including virus-protection applications, all Microsoft Office applications, Microsoft Messenger for Mac, and Office Notifications, because they might interfere with installation.  
2.  Open the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** volume on your desktop. This step might have been performed for you.  
3.  To start the update process, in the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** volume window, double-click the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** application, and follow the instructions on the screen.  
4.  If the installation finishes successfully, you can remove the update installer from your hard disk. To verify that the installation finished successfully, see the “Verifying Update Installation” section. To remove the update installer, first drag the **Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac 11.3.4 Update** volume to the Trash, and then drag the file that you downloaded to the Trash.
  
**Restart Requirement**
  
This update does not require you to restart your computer.
  
**Removal Information**
  
This update cannot be uninstalled.
  
**Verifying Update Installation**
  
To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, follow these steps:
  
1.  In the Finder, navigate to the Application Folder (**Microsoft Office 2004: Office**).  
2.  Select the file, **Microsoft Component Plugin**.  
3.  On the **File** menu click **Get Info** or **Show Info**.
  
If the Version number is **11.3.4**, the update has been successfully installed.

**Software Update Services:**
  
By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.
  
For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the [Software Update Services Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133).
  
**Windows Server Update Services:**
  
By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.
  
For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).
  
**Systems Management Server:**
  
Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the [SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939). SMS 2.0 users can also use [Software Updates Service Feature Pack](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340) to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the [SMS Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158).
  
**Note** SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following [Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341). Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the [SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387) and in the [SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161)) to install these updates.
