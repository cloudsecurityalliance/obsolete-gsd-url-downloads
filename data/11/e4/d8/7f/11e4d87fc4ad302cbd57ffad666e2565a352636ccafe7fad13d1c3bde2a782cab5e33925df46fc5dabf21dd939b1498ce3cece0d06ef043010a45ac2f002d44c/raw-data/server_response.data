<P><B>Recommended Actions:</B><BR>
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow 
networking and security best practices by implementing 
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate 
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such 
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya 
products and the surrounding network from this potential 
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these 
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided 
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied. 
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the 
customer's security policies may be required during this 
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product 
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.  
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.</P>

<H3>Mitigating Factors:</H3>
<P>When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as 
outlined by Avaya's 
<A HREF="https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674">
Security Vulnerability Classification Policy</A>. 
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific 
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:</P>
