<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This update resolves several newly-discovered, privately-reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own “Vulnerability Details” section.</p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. However, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities would most likely cause the affected system to stop responding.</p>
<p>We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.</p>

Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update  
----------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Why did Microsoft update this bulletin on June 14, 2005**  
Microsoft updated this bulletin today to advise customers that a revised version of the security update is available. The original security update successfully addressed the vulnerabilities described in this security bulletin. However, there is a known network connectivity issue that affects a particular type of network configuration when using the original security update. For more information on this issue see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 898060](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/898060/). [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 893066](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/893066) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this revised security update.  
We are distributing this re-release broadly to customers to help reduce the likelihood that customers will encounter this network connectivity issue in the future. We recommend installing this revised security update even if you have installed the previous version. The revised security update will be available through Windows Update, Software Update Services (SUS), and will be recommended by the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), except on certain systems as documented in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 901159](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/901159/). Customers that have installed the hotfix that was available to address this network connectivity issue should also install the revised security update. It is not necessary to uninstall the prior security update or hotfix prior to installing the revised security update.

</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-icmp-connection-reset-vulnerability---can-2004-0790">Workarounds for ICMP Connection Reset Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0790:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Block all ICMP network packets at the firewall or at the router:</strong></p>
<p>ICMP network packets are used to initiate a connection with the affected components. Blocking them at the firewall or at the router will help protect systems that are behind that firewall or router from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. We recommend that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet. ISA Server 2000 and ISA Server 2004 can be used to block the affected types of traffic.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> This workaround can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. ICMP network packets can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Block ICMP traffic by using IPSec on the affected systems.</strong></p>
<p>Use Internet Protocol security (IPSec) to help protect network communications. Detailed information about IPSec and about how to apply filters is available in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313190" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 313190</a> and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813878" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 813878</a>.</p>

Those connections would have to be re-established for normal communication to continue. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The affected messages are not being ignored in certain cases that allow an attacker to send a malformed packet which may cause the reset of an existing connection.</p>
<p><strong>What is TCP/IP?</strong><br/>
TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems.

For more information about TCP/IP, see the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40954" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is ICMP?</strong><br/>
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a required TCP/IP standard that is defined in RFC 792, &quot;Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).&quot; Hosts and routers that use IP communication can report errors and exchange limited control and status information using ICMP.<br/>
ICMP messages are usually sent automatically in one of the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>An IP datagram cannot reach its destination.</li>
<li>An IP router (gateway) cannot forward datagrams at the current rate of transmission.</li>
<li>An IP router redirects the sending host to a better route to the destination.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the <strong>ping</strong> command to send ICMP echo request messages and to record the receipt of ICMP echo reply messages. By using these messages, you can detect network or host communication failures and troubleshoot common TCP/IP connectivity problems.

<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable Path MTU Discovery.</strong><br/>
Disabling Path MTU Discovery will prevent an attacker from specifying a low MTU value that could degrade network performance by following these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys And Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type &quot;<strong>regedt32</strong>&quot; (without the quotation marks), and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>In Registry Editor, locate the following registry key: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters</strong></li>
<li>Add the DWORD Value: <strong>EnablePMTUDiscovery</strong>. Set the value to <strong>0</strong>. This value disables Path MTU Discovery. By default, this key does not exist.</li>
<li>You must restart your system for this change to take effect.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> These changes will help prevent attacks restricting the ability of an attacker to reduce the Path MTU value to a low value. This setting can also negatively impact performance by preventing TCP from optimizing network communication. This optimization can eliminate fragmentation at routers connecting networks with different MTUs. Fragmentation reduces TCP throughput and increases network congestion. For more information about <strong>EnablePMTUDiscovery</strong>, see the following <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/58752.mspx" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What is Path MTU Discovery?</strong><br/>
Path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) discovery is the process of discovering the maximum size of packet that can be sent across the network between two hosts without fragmentation (that is, without the packet being broken into multiple frames during transmission). It is described in RFC 1191. For more information, see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1191.txt?number=1191" data-linktype="external">RFC 1191</a>. For additional information, see the following <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms817967.aspx" data-linktype="external">MSDN Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is wrong with the Path MTU Discovery process?</strong><br/>
Path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) discovery allows an attacker to specify a value that can degrade network performance for other connections. On unsecured networks, allowing PMTU discovery carries the risk that an attacker might force the MTU to a very small value and overwork the local system's TCP/IP stack. Normally this behavior would be restricted to the single connection that an attacker could establish. However, this vulnerability allows an attacker to modify the MTU value on other connections beyond their own connection to the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to degrade network performance.</p>
<p><strong>Who could exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Any anonymous user who could deliver a specially crafted message to the affected system could try to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted message and sending the message to an affected system. The message could then cause the affected system to degrade network performance.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
All affected operating systems are at risk from this vulnerability. However, servers are at primary risk from this vulnerability because they maintain connections with clients that could be vulnerable to performance degradation.</p>
<p><strong>Could the vulnerability be exploited over the Internet?</strong><br/>
Yes. An attacker could try to exploit this vulnerability over the Internet. By default, the Microsoft Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) allows these kinds of malicious network packets and cannot be used to filter them.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by restricting the minimum value of the MTU to 576 bytes. This update also modifies the way that the affected operating systems validate ICMP requests.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2004-1060.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142" data-linktype="external">denial of service</a> vulnerability. An attacker who exploited this vulnerability could cause the affected system to stop responding for a limited time. During that time, affected systems cannot respond to requests. Note that the denial of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or elevate their user rights, but it could cause the affected system to stop accepting requests.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The affected operating systems perform incomplete validation of TCP/IP network packets. This vulnerability occurs when a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) SYN packet is received with a spoofed source Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number that is identical to that of the destination IP address and port. The effect of this makes it appear that the host computer has sent a packet to itself. If this attack is successful, a loop is created and extra computer CPU time is used.</p>
<p><strong>What is TCP/IP?</strong><br/>
TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic.

<p><strong>Notes</strong> The Windows XP security update is packaged as a dual-mode package. Dual-mode packages contain files for the original version of Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1) and files for Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2).
For more information about dual-mode packages, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/328848" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 328848</a>.
When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP SP2
The installer copies the SP2QFE files to your system.</li>
<li>Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
The installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, one of the following conditions occurs, depending on your operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows XP SP2
The installer copies the SP2GDR files to your system.</li>
<li>Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium)
The installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium), this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 for Itanium-based Systems security update.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.</p>
<p>For Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 1, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition, Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB893066\Filelist</p>
<p>For Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003 (Itanium):</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP1\KB893066\Filelist</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> These registry keys may not contain updated information for the revised version of this security update if the original version was installed. See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/901168" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 901168</a> for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 893066 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="windows-2000-all-versions">Windows 2000 (all versions)</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>

<p><strong>Software Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133" data-linktype="external">Software Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Management Server:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>.
