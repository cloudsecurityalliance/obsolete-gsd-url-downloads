                           VULNERABILITY SUMMARY

VULNERABILITY:   "Record of death" vulnerability

PLATFORMS:       AIX 5.3, 6.1, and earlier releases

SOLUTION:        Apply the fix as described below.

THREAT:          See below

CVE Numbers:	 CVE-2009-3245
		 CVE-2010-0433
		 CVE-2010-0740

                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION (from cve.mitre.org)

    "In TLS connections, certain incorrectly formatted records can cause 
    an OpenSSL client or server to crash due to a read attempt at NULL."
    "OpenSSL before 0.9.8m does not check for a NULL return value from 
    bn_wexpand function calls in (1) crypto/bn/bn_div.c, 
    (2) crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c, (3) crypto/ec/ec2_smpl.c, and (4) engines/
    e_ubsec.c, which has unspecified impact and context-dependent attack 
    vectors." 

    "The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL 
    before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration 
    files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which 
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer 
    dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as 
    demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without 
    Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot." 

    "The ssl3_get_record function in ssl/s3_pkt.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f 
    through 0.9.8m allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service 
    (crash) via a malformed record in a TLS connection that triggers a 
    NULL pointer dereference, related to the minor version number."

II. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

    To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following
    command:

    lslpp -L openssl.base

    The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

|   AIX 6.1 and 5.3: all versions less than 0.9.8.1103
|   AIX 6.1 and 5.3: FIPS capable versions less than 12.9.8.1103
|   AIX 5.2: all versions less than 0.9.8.806

|   IMPORTANT: If AIX OpenSSH is in use, it must be updated to version
|   5.0 or later, depending on the OpenSSL version. Refer  to the Readme
|   for each version's specific requirements.

    AIX OpenSSH can be downloaded from:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/openssh-aix

III. FIXES

    A fix is available, and it can be downloaded from:

    https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=aixbp

    To extract the fixes from the tar file:

    zcat openssl.0.9.8.1103.tar.Z | tar xvf -
    or
    zcat openssl-fips.12.9.8.1103.tar.Z | tar xvf -
    or
    zcat openssl.0.9.8.806.tar.Z | tar xvf -

    IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
    of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
    readable before proceeding.

    To preview the fix installation:

    installp -apYd . openssl

    To install the fix package:

    installp -aXYd . openssl

IV. WORKAROUNDS

    There are no workarounds.
