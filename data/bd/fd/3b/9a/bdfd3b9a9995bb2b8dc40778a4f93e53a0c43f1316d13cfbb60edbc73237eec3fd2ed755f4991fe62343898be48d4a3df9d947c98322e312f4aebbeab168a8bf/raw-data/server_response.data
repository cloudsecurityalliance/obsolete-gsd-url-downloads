                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION 
   
    CVE-2014-2532
    OpenSSH could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, 
    caused by the inclusion of wildcard characters in the AcceptEnv lines of the sshd_config 
    configuration file within the sshd program.By using a substring before a wildcard character, 
    an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass intended environment restrictions.

    CVE-2014-2653 
    OpenSSH could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by an error 
    in the SSH client when handling a HostCertificate. By persuading a victim to visit a 
    specially-crafted Web site containing a malicious certificate, an attacker could exploit 
    this vulnerability using a malicious server to disable SSHFP-checking.
