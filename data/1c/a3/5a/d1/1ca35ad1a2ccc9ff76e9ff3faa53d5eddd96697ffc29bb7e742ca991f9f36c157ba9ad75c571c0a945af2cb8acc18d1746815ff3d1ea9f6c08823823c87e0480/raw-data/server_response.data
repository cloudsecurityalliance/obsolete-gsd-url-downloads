<p>CVSS: 4.8</p>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60889" rel="nofollow">60889</a> Provisioning calls do not always consider server name/ID when looking up contexts</h4>

<p>Missed possibility to check if a context exists in a certain server.This has been solved by adding possibility to check a context’s existence in the scope of the registered server, in which the called provisioning node is running in. Thus the client is able to check before-hand, in which setup a context exists.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60828" rel="nofollow">60828</a> Segmented updates doesn’t work with multiple domains</h4>

<p>The feature has been designed to only serve one migrationRedirect URL.This has been solved by adding the possibility to configure the migrationRedirectURL on a per-host base via the as-config.yml</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60826" rel="nofollow">60826</a> Sharing is not fully capable to deal with “segmented updates”</h4>

<p>The LOCATED_IN_ANOTHER_SERVER exception was not properly handled in the ShareServlet.This has been fixed by handling the exception properly, i.e. redirect the client to the appropriate node. Introduced a new migrationRedirectURL property for the ShareServlet to use in order to send a redirect to the correct node.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=60455" rel="nofollow">60455</a> Object doesn’t support property or method ‘from’ with mailto link with IE11</h4>

<p>Code minifier broke the sanitizer plugin.This has been fixed by upgrading the code minifier to a newer version.</p>

<h2><a name="4842"></a>Patch Release 4842 (2018-07-19)</h2>

<h3>Shipped Components and Versions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open-Xchange Documentconverter API 7.8.3-rev6</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=58186" rel="nofollow">58186</a> Document converter breaks with Apache load-balancing</h4>

<p>Due to active load balancing between Middleware and Documentconverter server nodes, the PDF results for creating each ManagedFile were taken from different Documentconverter server nodes. In some document cases, this might give slightly different results due to contained date or other fields, evaluated and written at conversion time on each Documentconverter node.This has been solved by ensuring that range requests for one document always create the same hash id even in case the file version is missing and adding appropriate synchronization code on a file id basis results in generating just one ManagedFile on Middleware side within the Ajax request handler. The PDF result file is created from one DC server node only for the sequence of range requests for one document, even in case the file version is missing.</p>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55894" rel="nofollow">55894</a> Making <code>rampup</code> calls configurable for debugging</h4>

<p>In certain environments the API <code>rampup</code> delivery inconsistent response times. We added debug logging if preconditions for this API exceed a specific threshold and added functionality to allow disabling those preconditions. Note that this serves solely to support debugging of actual issues and should not be used by default. See SCR-63 for more information.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55409" rel="nofollow">55409</a> Inconsistent sort order at contact lists</h4>

<p>Japanese sort order for contact lists at mail compose and the Contacts app were inconsistent. We updated the sort mechanism at those places to deliver consistent results.</p>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=56499" rel="nofollow">56499</a> Incorrect attachment names in Japanese</h4>

<p>Lenticular brackets were removed from the list of valid characters, which broke certain attachment names as those characters appear to be common in Japanese. We’re now maintaining those characters when providing attachment information.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=56486" rel="nofollow">56486</a> Incorrect attachment names in Japanese</h4>

<p>RFC2231 encoded parameters where incorrectly decoded when handling attachments. This broke certain attachment names as such encodings appear to be common in Japanese. We’ve corrected decoding and now provide correct attachment information.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=56415" rel="nofollow">56415</a> Push related debug messages at log files</h4>

<p>Registration and de-registration messages of push clients have been logged at <code>INFO</code> level before, which could create large amounts of log data. As this information is supposed to be used for debugging purposes, we’re now logging it at log-level <code>DEBUG</code>. This solution has to be validated in a production environment.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=56400" rel="nofollow">56400</a> Links missing in certain HTML mails</h4>

<p>Specific HTML mails where handled incorrectly due to a recent sanitizing change for HTML style expressions. In case where such styles got applied to hyper-links the link would potentially not work. We adjusted HTML parsing to avoid this.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=56040" rel="nofollow">56040</a> Mail addresses missing at auto-complete</h4>

<p>In case the same mail address is used for multiple contacts, only one contact would be available when using address auto-complete for mail and other scenarios. To avoid this glitch we updated the filter to consider contacts to be unique in case their address are equal but names differ.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55872" rel="nofollow">55872</a> Removed “Open in browser” for IE</h4>

<p>Microsoft Office attempts to render documents within the browser instead of downloading them, however not considering cookies required to fetch the requested information. As a result user experience suffers when trying to view or edit MS Office documents stored within OX App Suite. For this and other reasons we decided to remove the “Open in browser” option when using IE-based browsers. We suggest to use OX Documents for in-browser editing work-flows.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55096" rel="nofollow">55096</a> Dragging a folder into Drive in App Suite UI results in unspecific error</h4>

<p>UI changed response so it looked like the currently logged in user confirmed the appointment. This has been fixed by using the actual user that confirmed instead of the currently logged in user.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=55012" rel="nofollow">55012</a> “Email has no recipient” message is shown after deleting a duplicated recipient</h4>

<p>This was caused by same identifier in collection and has been fixed by using unique identifiers so there are no duplicates anymore.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54894" rel="nofollow">54894</a> E-mail gets only displayed partly</h4>

<p>Mail uses absolute positioning. Email exceeded internal limit (32KB) for specific post-processing. Raise size limit for that particular post-processing to 128KB for Chrome, 64KB for other browsers to display those emails.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54877" rel="nofollow">54877</a> Tasks cannot be deleted</h4>

<p>Duplicate entries were written to the <code>del_task</code> folder table. This has been fixed by only writing the most current ones.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54863" rel="nofollow">54863</a> Restart of more than one middleware nodes take a long time</h4>

<p>This has been solved by avoiding too many request to all possible DB-Schemas and improving start-up of middleware nodes for setups holding millions of contexts.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54534" rel="nofollow">54534</a> Socket monitoring support</h4>

<p>To allow debugging potential network and remote service issues more efficiently, we added sup- port to log connection status and usage metrics for each socket that gets opened to an external system (e.g. Database, IMAP). See Change SCR-24 for more information.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53947" rel="nofollow">53947</a> Monthly calendar view does not scroll to previous month</h4>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54808" rel="nofollow">54808</a> CacheAware does not work for Drive folders</h4>

<p>When programmatically working with Drive folders, they could be declared to be <code>CacheAware</code> but this property did not change the folders behavior in terms of cache handling. This has been resolved and needs to he validated at the specific implementation.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54790" rel="nofollow">54790</a> Getting quota does not work anymore</h4>

<p>When requesting quota information for non-existing file storage accounts a runtime exception was thrown instead of properly handling the case. This has now been corrected.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54702" rel="nofollow">54702</a> Rename folder pop-up not closing</h4>

<p>The dialog to rename a folder in App Suite would not close under very special conditions. This has been researched and a potential workaround got applied. The effectiveness of this solutions needs to be validated for the environment in question.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54701" rel="nofollow">54701</a> Unable to copy raw image content to mail compose with IE11</h4>

<p>When copying raw image content from apps like MS Paint to mail compose, rather than just adding that image via drag&amp;drop or the provided composer options, its content did not get pasted when using IE11. This has been corrected for this particular case, however note that copy&amp;paste is implemented very inconsistently across browsers and operating systems, other cases will potentially not work as expected since the browser does not provide necessary information to web applications.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54586" rel="nofollow">54586</a> Inconsistency for saving drafts when using attachments from Drive</h4>

<p>When adding attachments to a Mail from OX Drive, they were added when saving a mail as draft but not removed when removing the attachment. This behavior has been corrected in a way that mail attachments are never stored when saving as draft.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54453" rel="nofollow">54453</a> Account help page missing</h4>

<p>A particular help page for external accounts was incorrectly linked, this has been corrected.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54437" rel="nofollow">54437</a> Contact collector not working</h4>

<p>Collecting contact information while reading mail was not working when combining specific mail handling (seen/unseen) in combination with contact collection. This has been solved.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51742" rel="nofollow">51742</a> Usability improvement when handling appointment invitations</h4>

<p>When receiving invitations or modifications of an appointment, we did show a very prominent pane that allows users to accept/decline. However some users still tried to manually import the attached ICS file which led to a series of problems. This is now being avoided by hiding ICS attachments in cases where we already show the accept/decline pane.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51194" rel="nofollow">51194</a> Ability to disable adding attachments to PIM apps via configuration</h4>

<p>A new frontend-side configuration option has been added to disable the “add attachment” area when creating or editing PIM objects. Note that this is purely cosmetic and does not affect other clients than OX App Suite. See Change #4301 for more information.</p>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54532" rel="nofollow">54532</a> Confusing error message “Folder INBOX has been closed on mail server”</h4>

<p>Confusing displayed error message. Solution: Rephrased error messages dealing about connectivity issues to mail server to have a more user-friendly information. Moreover added the “Please try again later.” suffix to hint to a possibly temporary nature of the issue.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54377" rel="nofollow">54377</a> Generating missing MD5 sums on filestore Objects causes high read load</h4>

<p>There might be situations where the metadata for stored infostore documents does not indicate the referenced files MD5 checksum. This may be the case for files that were stored more than 4 years ago, or for files that have been uploaded in chunks, e.g. during a migration. When synchronizing via OX Drive, the missing checksums for those files are calculated on demand, which requires the files to be retrieved from the underlying storage. When having many or very large files where the checksum needs to be calculated for, this may lead to an increased read load which may impact other processes and systems in the installation. This has been fixed by providing functionality to calculate missing file checksums on demand.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54349" rel="nofollow">54349</a> Edge crashes on large attachments</h4>

<p>Too much memory and CPU usage by canvas resize. Integrate canvas resize into our lazyload mechanism so not every picture is processed simultaniously to solve this issue.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54348" rel="nofollow">54348</a> Attachment filename wrong when forward email</h4>

<p>Building the forwarded mail calling setHeader erased the header information about file name. This has been solved by calling <code>setHeader</code> first and set the file name header afterwards.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54311" rel="nofollow">54311</a> Unable to send mail with onboard external account as sender</h4>

<p>A SMTP server which responds with non standards-compliant multi-line greeting on socket connect messed up parsing of server’s capabilities. This has been solved by dealing with multi-line greetings from SMTP server.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54262" rel="nofollow">54262</a> No timeout message if loading modules fails</h4>

<p>No error message on require timeout. This has been fixed by adding timeout message and reload option with longer timeout (30 seconds).</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54177" rel="nofollow">54177</a> Creating folders or renaming folders to prefix A- or B- does not show</h4>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54315" rel="nofollow">54315</a> Incompatibility with SIEVE rules</h4>

<p>When running OX App Suite 7.8.3 and 7.8.4 against a shared mail environment, SIEVE filter rules could unintentionally affect each other, for example auto-forward and vacation notice. This got fixed by retaining commented script content which is unknown to the 7.8.4 implementation.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54309" rel="nofollow">54309</a> Re-authorizing a oAuth account led to errors</h4>

<p>When re-authorizing a oAuth account, for example after changing its password or revoking access, a runtime exception was thrown. This got fixed by considering empty authorization tokens.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54181" rel="nofollow">54181</a> Config-cascade inconsistency for value pairs</h4>

<p>Certain value pairs where not correctly distributed by the config cascade mechanism, especially those related to services that use oAuth for authentication. We solved this by making those properties config-cascade aware.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54174" rel="nofollow">54174</a> Unexpected oAuth option for external accounts</h4>

<p>When having external mail access via oAuth disabled, the corresponding option was not properly hidden. This got solved to immediately start the non-oAuth wizard instead.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54136" rel="nofollow">54136</a> Incorrect permission restriction when moving folders in Drive</h4>

<p>When moving/copying a folder from a external storage service to folder of the primary OX Drive storage service, a permission related error was thrown. This got solved by properly setting administrator privileges to the creator of a OX Drive folder while copying/moving in folders from external services.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54133" rel="nofollow">54133</a> Sharing dialog stuck when sharing locked file</h4>

<p>When attempting to share a file which is locked, the sharing dialog did not close when canceling the operation. This got solved by handling potential errors related to locks when trying to share a file.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54069" rel="nofollow">54069</a> Fuzzy fallback for unsupported languages</h4>

<p>In certain cases the frontend language did fall back to german instead of english. This got fixed by setting a explicit fallback to en_US if the browser provides a unsupported language and no previously set OX language cookie.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54067" rel="nofollow">54067</a> Outdated “unsupported browsers” message</h4>

<p>OX App Suite UI did display incorrect recommendations for mobile browsers when using such as a desktop browser. This has been solved and we’re now showing recommendations for mobile browsers only when using a mobile device.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54042" rel="nofollow">54042</a> Unable to update dates with Japanese locale</h4>

<p>When defining start/end dates at the calendar on mobile browsers, the supplied data did not get taken over to the appointment. This was caused by incompatibility of a date/time format library with specific languages and has been fixed by making sure the same date/time format is used at all related components.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54041" rel="nofollow">54041</a> Missing schema information for database timeout errors</h4>

<p>In case a database connection reported a communication failure or timeout, the specific database schema was not part of the exception. This has now been added to allow simple debugging of affected database clusters.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53958" rel="nofollow">53958</a> More debug background for exceptions related to closed IMAP folders</h4>

<p>In case a IMAP backend did close a connection due to technical issues or timeouts, the resulting stack-trace at OX App Suite middleware was rather generic. This has been improved in a way that we now show the related IMAP command to allow better debugging. This issue has to be validated in production environments that show such unexpected behavior.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53945" rel="nofollow">53945</a> Duplicate paste on certain systems</h4>

<p>On few macOS based systems images were pasted twice to mail compose when using the operating systems copy&amp;paste feature and hitting a specific timing pattern. Additional checks were added to avoid importing duplicate content.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53923" rel="nofollow">53923</a> Quick reply disappears after the first reply</h4>

<p>When using “quick reply” to answer a mail, this option will disappear. We changed the behavior in a way that the option stays available after using it.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53916" rel="nofollow">53916</a> Adding local files opens camera App on iOS</h4>

<p>When using OX App Suite UI with Safari on iOS, the action to add a local attachment resulted in immediate launch of the camera App. We now trigger a selection menu which offers to either use the camera or access existing photos on the device.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53688" rel="nofollow">53688</a> Contacts with Katakana “yomi” fields were sorted as “other”</h4>

<p>When using Japanese language settings and subsequently “yomi” contact fields, those contacts were sorted incorrectly as “other”, which got solved.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53671" rel="nofollow">53671</a> Specific mails produced empty printouts</h4>

<p>When printing specific mails that define CSS, the created print version did not show substantial content. This got fixed by dropping certain CSS elements from our whitelist that could lead to broken layouts. See Change #4204.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53649" rel="nofollow">53649</a> Folder IDs were shown in PIM objects attachment details</h4>

<p>For PIM objects with attachments we did show the hyperlinks pointing to OX Drive instead of the corresponding App. To avoid confusion we did visually remove those links as they provide almost no functionality.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53474" rel="nofollow">53474</a> Duplicate recipients when sending mail</h4>

<p>When sending a mail to all appointment participants the resulting mail compose did contain duplicates of the expected recipients. This got solved by detecting and removing the currently logged in user from that list.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53437" rel="nofollow">53437</a> Inconsistency for thumbnails and image preview</h4>

<p>Certain file formats (tiff, psd, pbm) were shown as thumbnail preview while not being supported in image preview. To ensure consistency we added support for tiff and psd files to image preview.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52633" rel="nofollow">52633</a> Adding huge photos to HTML mail led to high CPU load</h4>

<p>When checking for validity of a uploaded image, the size limitations were not considered, which in turn led to higher than expected processing effort. The logic got changed to apply limitations prior to analyze validity of an image. If that action fails, the affected image is being removed from mail compose and a error is logged.</p>

<p>When updating an OAuth account (applying a new name), the enabled scopes was accidentally reseted.This has been solved by not touching OAuth account’s enabled scopes when updating its name.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53795" rel="nofollow">53795</a> POP3 External account: messages retrieved are duplicated</h4>

<p>Certain POP3 server’s do not obey to advertise UIDLs with at max. 70 characters.This has been fixed by extending the “uidl” column in “pop3_storage_ids” and “pop3_storage_deleted” tables from 70 to 128 characters as some POP3 server advertise bigger UIDL values. An Updatetask will be triggered with this fix.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53690" rel="nofollow">53690</a> Fields considered for sorting / categorizing contacts inconsistent</h4>

<p>A contact’s (yomi-) firstname was not taken into account during sort name generation in case no (yomi-) lastname was set.This has been solved by using combination of (yomi-) last- and firstname per default as sort name.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53689" rel="nofollow">53689</a> Yomi fields not available / visible with non-Japanese language setting</h4>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53674" rel="nofollow">53674</a> Japanese attachment filenames broken for some sender MUAs</h4>

<p>“name” and “filename” values were parsed in a wrong way from parameter list of Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers.This has been fixed by properly parsing file name from MIME part headers.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53524" rel="nofollow">53524</a> Japanese translation: Inconsistent translation for the word “all”</h4>

<p>Some are translated with Kanji and the others with Hiragana, which gives the end users inconsistent look and feel.Now all are translated with Hiragana.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53340" rel="nofollow">53340</a> Appointment status of participant not updated via EAS</h4>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53790" rel="nofollow">53790</a> Problem with executing SQL: Deadlock found when trying to get lock</h4>

<p>Possible dead lock situation through concurrent context create operations that imply to add data to “contextAttribute” table in context-associated payload database.This has been solved by adding retry strategy with exponential back-off and added optional lock to ‘contextAttribute’ table to ultimately serialize concurrent write operations. Whether the lock is supposed to be acquired is controlled through newly introduced “LOCK_ON_WRITE_CONTEXT_INTO_PAYLOAD_DB” property in file ‘hosting.properties’.  Default is “false”.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51967" rel="nofollow">51967</a> Missing distribution lists in Outlook</h4>

<p>When syncing Outlook using USM, certain amounts and combinations of contacts and distribution lists could lead to a situation where only a subset of contacts but not all distribution lists got synced. This has been solved by sorting the type of object (contact, distribution list) prior to performing the sync operation.

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52518" rel="nofollow">52518</a> Compatibility fix for Debian and systemd</h4>

<p>The Debian project did rename the initial process from <code>systemd</code> to <code>init</code> when moving to Debian 8.7. Some areas of our startup scripts depend on this name to determine whether systemd is used or not. We’re now querying <code>/proc/1/comm</code> to figure out the kind and name of process that takes care about inits.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52437" rel="nofollow">52437</a> oxsysreport tries to read nonexisting files</h4>

<p>When running <code>oxsysreport</code> while having OX Guard installed, false-positives for password blacklisting could occur. As a result errors were reported by the <code>oxsysreport</code> tool, which has been solved by adjusting the regular expression for parameter blacklisting.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52314" rel="nofollow">52314</a> Unicode decoding fails for multi-line mail subjects</h4>

<p>In case a E-Mail subject spans multiple lines where each consists of UTF-8 mail-safe base64 encoded characters, decoding partly failed and Unicode characters were displayed in a scrambled way. This has been solved by properly handling such split subjects and encoding each part independently.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52238" rel="nofollow">52238</a> Typo at NRFILES property at startscript</h4>

<p>A typo at the <code>/opt/open-xchange/sbin/open-xchange</code> script led to a situation where custom configured “nofiles” limits where not correctly applied to the process. This has been solved by correcting the properties name and adding a log message to <code>open-xchange-console.log</code> in case the process fails to set this limit.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52235" rel="nofollow">52235</a> Missing custom favicons</h4>

<p>Newer versions of Firefox use the largest icon presented as <code></code> as favicon, which defaults to a unbranded OX icon. Originally this handling was introduced to set a “homescreen” icon when using the appropriate functionality on mobile operating systems. This was solved by removing the corresponding tag when using desktop operating systems.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52198" rel="nofollow">52198</a> Applying OX Drive folder permissions recursively</h4>

<p>A feature backport has been performed to allow recursive inheritance of OX Drive folder permissions when changing a parent folder.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52181" rel="nofollow">52181</a> Firefox drop-zone overlaps mail list</h4>

<p>When using a specific series of gestures while importing a .eml file to a mailbox, a Firefox bug on Windows and macOS got triggered which kept the “drop zone” visible after dropping the file outside of the browser window. This subsequently blocked other user interaction with the mail list. We added a workaround for this browser bug in a way that clicking outside the drop zone will revert its state.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52161" rel="nofollow">52161</a> Missing mails on mobile devices when using mail categories</h4>

<p>When using mail categories with a desktop browser and moving mails to specific categories, those mails would not be displayed at Inbox anymore when using the same account using a mobile browser. We solved this by avoiding categorization Inbox if the corresponding feature set is not available on the currently used platforms.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52157" rel="nofollow">52157</a> IMAP master-auth user name provided to client</h4>

<p>In case of specific IMAP errors related to <code>EXPUNGE</code> commands, a detailed error message was returned to the user, which could contain a user-name for IMAP master authentication. This was solved by removing detailed error message contents for that IMAP command.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52151" rel="nofollow">52151</a> Drop zone for .eml not disappearing if a file is not dropped with firefox on Windows</h4>

<p>Firefox does not trigger dragleave or mouseout correctly.This has been fixed by using mouseenter to remove the dropzone when the mouse enter the window without dragged files.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52123" rel="nofollow">52123</a> Unable to change mail account name with certain mail configurations</h4>

<p>If a user was changing its mail account displayname while the middleware uses a “global” <code>mailServerSource</code> setting, incorrect host names were applied. As a result the displayname could not be changed. We solved this by applying the appropriate host name to avoid erroneous responses during the operation.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52104" rel="nofollow">52104</a> Untraceable database timeouts during share cleanup</h4>

<p>Once the <code>PeriodicCleaner</code> task for shares was executed, potential SQL errors could not be traced since the related schema name was unknown. To allow further debugging we added<code>com.openexchange.database.schema</code> as parameter for this cleanup run. It will highlight which database schema triggered timeouts or other errors.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51997" rel="nofollow">51997</a> Shares created via Drivemail requested credentials</h4>

<p>When sending a mail attachment and using “Drive Mail” a password was requested even though a user did not enable this option. This could happen in cases where a user first specified a password but then un-ticked the related option. We solved this by checking the options state more carefully prior to creating the related share.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51967" rel="nofollow">51967</a> Missing distribution lists in Outlook</h4>

<p>When syncing Outlook using USM, certain amounts and combinations of contacts and distribution lists could lead to a situation where only a subset of contacts but not all distribution lists got synced. This has been solved by sorting the type of object (contact, distribution list) prior to performing the sync operation. This way the kind of objects retrieved at the client side stays consistent in case the total amount of objects exceeds the chunk size for one sync operation.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51918" rel="nofollow">51918</a> Calendar conflicts with UTC+12 timezones</h4>

<p>During conflict detection, the floating time-span of full-day appointments was calculated using the servers timezone (usually UTC) while other appointments used the timezone configured by the user. In cases where a large offset to UTC is present, there has been a <sup>50</sup>⁄<sub>50</sub> chance that appointments would conflict with full-day appointments at the previous or next day. We’re now calculating both values using the users specific timezone for conflict handling. This should bring down the probability of incorrect conflicts considerably.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51839" rel="nofollow">51839</a> Certain serious (non UCE/UBE) HTML mail is not displayed</h4>

<p>Too greedy check for possibly malicious content led to this issue.This has been solved by allowing properly parsed start tag.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51462" rel="nofollow">51462</a> Full-day appointments could not be converted with Lightning</h4>

<p>When using Thunderbird/Lightning and CalDAV of OX App Suite, full-day appointments could not be converted back to normal appointments using the CalDAV client. The reason for this was a client-specific CalDAV header used to indicate full-day appointments which caused issues with Lightning. We removed this header if the associated user-agent does not expect it.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51399" rel="nofollow">51399</a> Repeated mail sending when using Outlook</h4>

<p>In case a backend error did occur, like downtime of the mail storage, there could be situations where Outlook clients using USM get into a sending-loop, resulting to duplicated E-Mail. Those kind of errors are now handled by the USM API in accordance to the OX App Suite middleware error code.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51222" rel="nofollow">51222</a> Long loading times for documents with certain storages</h4>

<p>In case a large document gets requested off a slow cloud storage, very long loading times could happen and expected timeouts were not considered. This has been solved by adding additional timeouts that will kick in if a API request to the storage layer takes longer than anticipated.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51074" rel="nofollow">51074</a> Encoding issues with passwords</h4>

<p>In case certain operating systems got configured incorrectly, specifically RHEL6 and SLES11, usage of the <code>open-xchange-passwordchange-script</code> plugin could lead to incorrectly encoded passwords passed over to a script. This has been solved by adding an optional parameter as described by Change #4022 to allow base64 encoded transfer. Additionally, unexpected encoding configurations will get logged  to <code>open-xchange-console.log</code> to alert operators about potential follow-up issues.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50918" rel="nofollow">50918</a> Timezone issues with task start/due dates on negative timezone offsets</h4>

<p>When defining a start or due date for tasks while using a negative UTC offset, the selected date would be reported incorrectly. This has been solved by adjusting the full-day handling for tasks to the calendar implementation which uses UTC.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49236" rel="nofollow">49236</a> Messages regarding missing E-Mail</h4>

<p>Some OX App Suite UI requests did lead to error messages regarding E-Mail which could not be found. After analyzing the situation, we suspect that there is a issue with obfuscated folder names. A fallback has been added in case decoding a folder name failed.</p>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52013" rel="nofollow">52013</a> Enhancements to IMAP host detection and logging</h4>

<p>To allow better debugging and monitoring of interaction between OX App Suite and IMAP backends, a new parameter was added to parse the IMAP backends “greeting” and provide it as part of the OX App Suite log. This behaviour is configurable and described within release notes. When rolling out this Patch Release.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51910" rel="nofollow">51910</a> Optimizing IMAP IDLE handling and Hazelcast lookups</h4>

<p>When using IMAP IDLE in larger deployments (which OX does not recommend) it might happen that threads are getting blocked by attempts to look up and close associated push listeners in a cluster once a user closes a session. Using synchonization protocols like Exchange Active Sync triggers many sessions to be opened and closed in a relatively short period of time. While there might be configurations where only one IMAP IDLE push listener per user is allowed, in many cases this level of consistency is excessive and could lead to outages. Therefor we changed the behaviour to only look up “local” sessions rather than querying the whole cluster. This behaviour is configurable and described within release notes. When rolling out this Patch Release please have a close look to IMAP IDLE session count and modify the configuration in accordance to the environments requirements. To enhance overall performance of session lookups, a index has been added to the Hazelcast “sessions” map. As a result, clusters need to be completely updated and restarted when applying this patch release, the “sessions” map is not compatible with its earlier version.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51847" rel="nofollow">51847</a> Enhanced IMAP request tracking</h4>

<p>Logging has been extended to allow tracking individual IMAP activities/requests for a OX App Suite session which might use several IMAP connections. The new logging property is <br><code> com.openexchange.mail.session</code>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51772" rel="nofollow">51772</a> Unable to modify users own data</h4>

<p>In cases where the contact associated to the user account was created by the “oxadmin” account rather than the user itself, the user was unable to change its own contact data. Such situations may arise in specific provisioning implementations. Changing the contacts data is now possible again by correcting the mechanism to look up the oxadmin account as potential creator for the own contact.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51755" rel="nofollow">51755</a> Long-running script warnings when sending mail to huge recipient list</h4>

<p>When composing a mail to a list of several hundreds of recipients, browser warnings about unresponsive scripts occurred when trying to parse and tokenize the recipient list. The handling has been improved by 2-3x to allow a larger number of recipients.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51610" rel="nofollow">51610</a> Desktop notifications are not shown for negative timezone offsets</h4>

<p>When configuring a negative timezone offset (e.g. UTC-5), desktop notifications would not be shown since the timestamp of newly received mails was checked against UTC rather than the users timezone.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51602" rel="nofollow">51602</a> Incorrect encoding when using IMAP “plain” authentication</h4>

<p>In case mailbox login names allow multi-byte unicode characters, the login process would fail when using OX App Suite. This has been solved by applying the correct charset when performing the login procedure for mailboxes.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51207" rel="nofollow">51207</a> Error message shown if “default app” setting is empty</h4>

<p>In cases where a users configuration was damaged and the default app “none” has been selected, subsequent logins led to error messages. We’re now falling back to the global default app if the provided app cannot be found.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50982" rel="nofollow">50982</a> Empty “file count” for external cloud storage folders</h4>

<p>Some external cloud storage providers do not provide the amount of files within a folder, in such cases OX App Suite would should “0” for any folder at that storage. A new internal capability per storage has been added to signal wether the storage does provide that information without executing expensive computation or storage access. According to that capability, OX App Suite UI will remove the “object count” indicator at folder details.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51859" rel="nofollow">51859</a> Changed API behaviour leads to issues with file uploads</h4>

<p>An earlier bugfix introduced a significant change to HTTP API behaviour, any change to the MIME-Type parameter has been rejected as a result. While OX clients were unaffected, this led to an incompatibility with third-party clients when using the “infostore” API for uploading and modifying files. We reduced the scope of the change to block MIME-Types that start with “multipart” instead, this should not affect the vast majority of use-cases for this API.</p>

<p>Did some improvemnts to avoid a crashing OX. Utilize a user-scoped lock mechanism to avoid having a global lock that might affect unrelated threads unnecessarily. Avoid duplicate remote session look-up.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51898" rel="nofollow">51898</a> Mail with invalid MIME type attachment cannot be displayed</h4>

<p>When you try to display or import an email which contains an attachment with an invalid MIME type as content type, an error was thrown.This has been fixed and it is possible to import and display the mail.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51727" rel="nofollow">51727</a> Mail icon stills appears in UI even though mail is not enabled</h4>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51569" rel="nofollow">51569</a> Primary mail address and aliases cannot be changed at the same time if the old primary mail address should be an alias</h4>

<p>During the createuser command an alias for the primary mail account is already added. This alias is equal to the upper case notation used in the create command. The change command now tries to add the same alias but with only lower case letters. This isn’t recognized and therefore the middleware tries to insert this alias to the db again which results in the duplicate entry error.Solution: Do a case independent check when comparing the old with the new aliases.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51548" rel="nofollow">51548</a> Moving files which already exist result in duplicate files with google drive</h4>

<h3>Fixed Bugs</h3>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50203" rel="nofollow">50203</a> Too many open files</h4>

<p>When using systemd instead of sysv, the configurable limit of “open files” was not correctly applied. This has been solved in combination with Change #3773.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50174" rel="nofollow">50174</a> Empty mail addresses lead to validation errors</h4>

<p>When storing empty values as mail address, certain provisioning code failed when changing a different parameter. This has been solved by allowing empty values in addition of <code>NULL</code> values when validating a change.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50101" rel="nofollow">50101</a> Vague error messages when uploading versions to Dropbox</h4>

<p>Some storage providers use file path as that files unique identifier. When adding a new version of the same file but with a different filename in OX Drive, that version will be created as a new file at the storage service and return vague error messages. We solved this by using unique names of additional files when adding a version. At the same time we dropped support for versioning, see Change #3756.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50094" rel="nofollow">50094</a> IMAP ghost-folders cannot be unsubscribed</h4>

<p>Depending on the mailbox format, folders might contain only other folders but no mails. When subscribing a subfolder and then deleting the parent folder, the subfolders remain subscribed and cannot be removed in App Suite. This has been solved by extending the IMAP folder consistency check.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50091" rel="nofollow">50091</a> Parsing errors for broken HTML mails</h4>

<p>Converting certain broken HTML mail to their plain-text representation failed due to compatibility issues with the used library. This has been solved by extending conversion support for that kind of mail.</p>

<p>In case the oxadminmaster account is configured to override oxadmin accounts, changing the password for oxadmin failed with a NPE. This was caused by incorrect cache invalidation in case oxadminmaster credentials werde used and got fixed accordingly.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50073" rel="nofollow">50073</a> Issues with specific sharing link configuration</h4>

<p>When using sharing links that contain a expiration date, recipient and password, some links fail to generate and are not sent. This was caused by a incompatible order of database statements and has been solved.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50038" rel="nofollow">50038</a> Incorrect <code>expires</code> header for fallback pictures</h4>

<p>When requesting a fallback image for a contact, for example when reading mail, the corresponding value of the <code>expires</code> response header was incorrectly set to a past date. This disabled caching of the response and led to unnecessary resource consumption. The problem has been solved by setting a future (+1 hour) date as value for the <code>expires</code> header.</p>

<p>Despite the users configuration print previews for mails were always using the HTML part of the message. This has been changed to respect the users configuration with regards to displaying HTML mail.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49937" rel="nofollow">49937</a> Pasting multiple address result in single recipient</h4>

<p>When taking over Email addresses from popular Office productivity suites by copy&amp;paste, those were detected as single recipient. This happened since that software does not detect the kind of data but simply provides a string without delimiters. We’ve added support for more delimiters than comma and semicolon to work around this issue.</p>

<p>Under certain circumstances, the organizer value was built from the user’s display name when serializing to iCal.This has been fixed by using the user’s e-mail address as organizer value if “primaryMail” is configured.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49304" rel="nofollow">49304</a> Crash on all Groupware Nodes</h4>

<p>A newly introduced login handler stored an user attribute on each login operation, and the corresponding cache invalidation event was distributed remotely throughout the cluster, which lead to an increased number of unnecessary events.This has been updated by only updating user attribute if it actually was changed, skip cluster-wide invalidation.</p>

<p>Copy command was able to run into overquota.This has been fixed by using move operation for clear folder command in case move operation is supported by IMAP server.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49074" rel="nofollow">49074</a> Appointment cancellation mail loop with iOS</h4>

<p>In rare cases the iOS Mail/Calendar clients decide to send out repeated cancellation mails. While the behaviour is triggered by the client we try to counter this behaviour by blocking cancellation mails at replies at OX App Suite when synchronizing.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49057" rel="nofollow">49057</a> Incorrect dates provided by WebDAV clients</h4>

<p>When mounting Drive using WebDAV, some clients provide incorrect creation times for files. This was caused by a incompatible date format and has been fixed by providing RFC1123 dates instead.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49007" rel="nofollow">49007</a> Address picker shows inaccessible folders</h4>

<p>When using the recipient picker for Email the second time while not having access to public and shared folders, those were shown as an option nonetheless. We fixed that by cleaning caches so the correct folders are provided as options.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48949" rel="nofollow">48949</a> Sometimes printing fails with “Drucken ist beim Starten des Druckvorgangs fehlgeschlagen.” on Preview</h4>

<p>Only affects calendar views as they are external, i.e. loaded from the server and was quite rare.This has been solved by implementing a delay to let the browser breathe. The delay is not really perceivable so it won’t annoy end-users.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48940" rel="nofollow">48940</a> Autologout setting is not hidden when protected</h4>

<p>In order keep the list at the address-book picker in sync with the Contacts app, identity circles can now be customized with regards to color. See SCR #3602.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48927" rel="nofollow">48927</a> Customization for contacts identity circle</h4>

<p>In order keep the list at the address-book picker in sync with the Contacts app, identity circles can now be customized with regards to name initials. See SCR #3602.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48883" rel="nofollow">48883</a> logconf -l com.openexchange.usm does not filter for UID/CID</h4>

<p>The logback filtering works in conjunction with the MDC properties, meaning that in order for a log filter to work, the userId, contextId and (optionally) sessionId have to be present in the MDC. In this case, the previous mentioned MDC properties were only applied upon a login request, hence the only DEBUG log entry that was visible in the log was that of the login request.This has been fixed by applying the MDC properties ‘userId’, ‘contextId’ and ‘sessionId’ (that is the USM session id and not OX session id) to the MDC when getting the USM session from the SessionStorage (which happens on every USM/EAS request).</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48851" rel="nofollow">48851</a> Zero-minute reminders not respected in public calendars</h4>

<p>When using public calendars and setting reminders to “0”, this value is treated as “no reminder”. This has been solved by signalling 0 as a legal value for appointments at such folders.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48778" rel="nofollow">48778</a> Contacts tab opens with ~20 Seconds Delay, Display-Errors after Tab Change Contacts to Calendar and back</h4>

<p>The new user setting “Start in global address book” (default: true) conflicts with an extremely slow loading of address book.This has been solved by checking if the user setting is configurable. If not, the user doesn’t see the setting. This fix neither accelerates the loading process nor does it avoid the invalid UI state if users go back and forth.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48748" rel="nofollow">48748</a> Distribution list view inconsistent, saving such a list does not work</h4>

<p>The error is cause by two update operations on a contact off the distribution list. If a contact off the distribution list is within the address-book of the user, then the entry within the distribution list will reference this contact. In case the email address referenced by the distribution list is removed the entry within the distribution list is also updated (now empty). If then in a next step the contact is deleted the entry within the distribution list will be changed to a contact without a reference. In this case the mail address within the distribution list will be used, which is still be empty. In this case the distribution list is invalid because of this missing mail address.The exception message now tells the user which contact is causing the error and therefore he is able to solve the issue himself.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48729" rel="nofollow">48729</a> Archive folder visibility</h4>

<p>In case users got provisioned with a specific name for the “Archive” folder, there was no way to remove that information afterwards. We’ve removed a sanitiy check for empty folder names and instead add “null” to the users mail configuration in case that folder shall be empty. As a result no folder will show up as “Archive” anymore. Note that using this functionality makes it mandatory to disable archive functionality as a capability for the user. Otherwise there will be inconsistencies and unexpected behaviour on the user-interface level, including re-creation of the “Archive” folder with its default values.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48687" rel="nofollow">48687</a> Carddav data with xD at the end of all lines</h4>

<p>The underlying org.jdom library adjusts line endings during serialization, for inline vCards in multistatus responses this led to duplicated carriage return characters. While usually the receiving side is in charge to normalize line endings during parsing, one particular client is not able to do so.Solution: Serialize inline vCards in CARDDAV:address-data property as CDATA.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48681" rel="nofollow">48681</a> Mail not displayed correctly on Android</h4>

<p>The mail contains two parts of type text/plain. The second part contains the greetings. USM handles only the first part for sending the mail in plain text format to the client (used by Android).With this fix USM concatenates all text/plain parts together.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48663" rel="nofollow">48663</a> No signature selected in settings after upgrade</h4>

<p>Missing signature handling for update.Introduced central helper function which considers the different states, value of defaultSignature (compose/reply) is now used as new default value for ‘defaultReplyForwardSignature’.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48654" rel="nofollow">48654</a> SpamExperts GUI page not displaying fully for SpamPanel</h4>

<p>The container element of settings pages doesn’t have a fixed height. This broke percentage-based height specification of its children.This has been fixed by using absolute positioning to make percentage-based heights work again.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48631" rel="nofollow">48631</a> Unexpected compression headers for SAML</h4>

<p>When using HTTP redirect bindings for single logout responses, our implementation did expect zlib headers while raw gzip was returned. This has been solved by handling this kind of input.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48630" rel="nofollow">48630</a> Missing attachment preview for very special mails</h4>

<p>When sending a mail to a mailing list and using a X.509 signature plus another attachment, that attachment could not get previewed in App Suite. This has been solved by avoiding to fetch ignorable parts of the mail.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48629" rel="nofollow">48629</a> Appointment jumps one day back if time changed more than 12h</h4>

<p>Local date instead of internal utc date were used in one calculation.This has been fixed by sticking to utc-based calculations.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48618" rel="nofollow">48618</a> Portal tiles show hidden files</h4>

<p>After displaying “hidden” files was disabled, they did still show up at the Drive portal tile of App Suite. This got solved by applying the correct filter to the tile as well.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48598" rel="nofollow">48598</a> Incomplete delete events sent when removing appointment series</h4>

<p>When deleting a recurring appointment, the related event mechanism did distribute events which refer to the recurring appointment but did not contain any pointers to exceptions of that series. We’re now sending more sophisticated objects that allow to gather references to exceptions of that recurring appointment.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48495" rel="nofollow">48495</a> New arriving mails are sorted somewhere into existing mails in list view</h4>

<p>Sort handler was called before models were drawn and list were messed up.This has been solved by skipping sort when queue contains items and sort manually once the queue has been processed.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48463" rel="nofollow">48463</a> Multiple honorific prefixes are comma-separated</h4>

<p>When using honorific prefixes, suffices or additional names at contacts, those details were transferred and serialized as individual attributes which led to display issues on some CardDAV clients. This has been solved by putting this information to single attribute.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48438" rel="nofollow">48438</a> Inconcistent folder order in Archive</h4>

<p>The Archive folder did list subfolders in descending date order to make sure the most recent folders are on top. However this did conflict with certain use-cases and added inconsistency, therefor we switched to alphabetically ascending order for all folders except numeric ones.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48394" rel="nofollow">48394</a> DOS encoding for paths.perfMap</h4>

<p>The file <code>paths.perfMap</code> was delivered with CRLF linebreaks, which of course does not make sense on Unix-style environments. We applied proper linebreaks again.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48380" rel="nofollow">48380</a> Unable to remove a directory in Drive</h4>

<p>In case a directory contained a hidden subfolder without permissions to the deleting users, removal of that enclosing folder failed without a sufficient error message. We’ve extended the OX Drive protocol to handle this situation and make clients aware of the root cause.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48364" rel="nofollow">48364</a> Unable to save mail to “Sent” folder after sending</h4>

<p>Getting the standard folders (e.g. for “Sent”) failed in case a spam/ham folders where absent but expected. The code has been hardened to deal with situations like this, which may occur when using custom spam handler implementations or configuration.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48349" rel="nofollow">48349</a> ‘AVERAGE_USER_SIZE’ not found in file /opt/open-xchange/etc</h4>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=48348" rel="nofollow">48348</a> Reporting issues with multiple registered servers</h4>

<p>When having contexts spread across different middleware clusters but using the same database backends, the report client did not finish its execution. This has been solved by considering such configurations and general hardening of the report functionality in this regard.</p>

<p>An infinite loop while trying to determine a folder’s reverse path to root folder caused the excessive creation of folder instances all kept in a wrapping java.util.ArrayList instance. It turned out that while loading the path for a folder from a subscribed external IMAP account, the special INBOX folder references itself as parent, consequently rendering the traversing loop infinite.This has been solved by introducing several safety checks (in case a folder references itself as parent) and guards to prevent from possible such an infinite loop when trying to determine a folder’s path to root folder.</p>

<h4><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=47378" rel="nofollow">47378</a> Contact csv import: error message very vague</h4>

If a row does not contain enough columns it will add empty columns at the end of the row. If a column in the middle of the row is missing all other entries will be shifted to the left. This leads to an error for the distribution list column, because the importer uses the data of another column for this field.This has been fixed by adding a new parameter “line_number” to the response result entry in case of an error, because it’s impossible to improve the handling of defective csv files.</p>
