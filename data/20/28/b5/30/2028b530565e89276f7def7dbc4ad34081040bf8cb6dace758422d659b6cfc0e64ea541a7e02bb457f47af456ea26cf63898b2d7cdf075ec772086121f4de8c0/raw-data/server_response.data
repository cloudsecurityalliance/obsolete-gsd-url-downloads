<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-windows-tcpip-could-allow-remote-code-execution-974145">Vulnerabilities in Windows TCP/IP Could Allow Remote Code Execution (974145)</h2>
<p>Published: February 09, 2010 | Updated: February 10, 2010</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if specially crafted packets are sent to a computer with IPv6 enabled. An attacker could try to exploit the vulnerability by creating specially crafted ICMPv6 packets and sending the packets to a system with IPv6 enabled. This vulnerability may only be exploited if the attacker is on-link.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing the way Windows TCP/IP performs bounds checking and other packet handling operations. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> None</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
Refer to the reference tables in the <strong>Security Update Deployment</strong> section for the location of the file information details.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle.

<p>It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555" data-linktype="external">Select a Product for Lifecycle Information</a>. For more information about service packs for these software releases, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213" data-linktype="external">Lifecycle Supported Service Packs</a>.</p>
<p>Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Worldwide Information</a> Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click <strong>Go</strong> to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ</a>.</p>

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code with elevated privileges on vulnerable systems. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability is caused by the Windows TCP/IP stack not performing the appropriate level of bounds checking on specially crafted ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets.
  
**What is TCP/IP?**   
TCP/IP is a set of networking protocols that are widely used on the Internet. TCP/IP provides communications across interconnected networks of computers that have diverse hardware architectures and that run various operating systems. TCP/IP includes standards for how computers communicate and conventions for connecting networks and for routing traffic. For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc739443(ws.10).aspx).
  
**What is IPv6?**   
Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), a new suite of standard protocols for the network layer of the Internet, is built into Microsoft Windows XP and later. IPv6 is designed to solve many of the problems of the current version of IP (known as IPv4) such as address depletion, security, autoconfiguration, and extensibility. To learn more about IPv6, please see the TechNet site, [FAQ for IPv6](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/network/bb530961.aspx).
  
**What are Router Advertisements?**   
Router Advertisements allow routers to instruct hosts how to perform Address Autoconfiguration. For example, routers can specify whether hosts should use DHCPv6 and/or autonomous (stateless) address configuration. Routers advertise their presence together with various link and Internet parameters either periodically, or in response to a Router Solicitation message. Router Advertisements contain prefixes that are used for determining whether another address shares the same link (on-link determination) and/or address configuration, a suggested hop limit value, etc. For more information about Router Advertisements and Neighbor Discovery in IPv6, see [RFC 4861](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4861).
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

For more information about TCP/IP, see the TechNet article, [Overview of networking and TCP/IP](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc739443(ws.10).aspx).
  
**What is an Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)?**   
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) provides confidentiality (in addition to authentication, integrity, and anti-replay protection) for the IP payload. ESP in transport mode does not sign the entire packet. Only the IP payload (not the IP header) is protected. ESP can be used alone or in combination with Authentication Header (AH).
  
**What is a Memory Descriptor List (MDL)?**   
A memory descriptor list (MDL) is a system-defined structure that describes a buffer by a set of physical addresses. A driver that performs direct I/O receives a pointer to an MDL from the I/O manager, and reads and writes data through the MDL. Some drivers also use MDLs when they perform direct I/O to satisfy a device I/O control request. For more information about MDLs, see the Windows Hardware Developer Central article, [What is really in that MDL?](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/tips/mdl.mspx)
  
**Does this attack require the UDP traffic to be fragmented?**   
No. This attack does not rely on fragmented network traffic. Instead, the fragmentation involved requires the network driver on the target system to fragment the UDP header into separate MDLs.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**
  
Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang=en).
  
The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch            | Description                                                                                                                                |  
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches.                                                                                                       |  
| **/quiet**        | Suppresses the display of status or error messages.                                                                                        |  
| **/norestart**    | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |
  
**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
