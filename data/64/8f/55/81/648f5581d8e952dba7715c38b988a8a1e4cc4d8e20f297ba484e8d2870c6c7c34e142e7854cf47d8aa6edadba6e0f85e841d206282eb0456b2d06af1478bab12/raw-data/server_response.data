SUMMARY:

    There are multiple vulnerabilities in NTP that impact AIX.


===============================================================================

VULNERABILITY DETAILS:

    CVEID: CVE-2015-5219
    DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) is vulnerable to a denial of 
        service, caused by an error in the sntp program. By sending specially 
        crafted NTP packets, a remote attacker from within the local network 
        could exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into
        an infinite loop.

    CVEID: CVE-2015-7691
    DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) is vulnerable to a denial of 
        service, caused by an error in ntp_crypto.c. An attacker could exploit 
        this vulnerability using a packet containing an extension field with an
        invalid value for the length of its value field to cause ntpd to crash.

    DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) could allow a remote attacker to
        obtain sensitive information, caused by a memory leak in CRYPTO_ASSOC.
        An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive 
        information.

    CVEID: CVE-2015-7850
    DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) is vulnerable to a denial of 
        service, caused by an error in the remote configuration functionality.
        By sending a specially crafted configuration file, an attacker could
        exploit this vulnerability to cause the application to enter into an
        infinite loop.

    CVEID: CVE-2015-7853
    DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) is vulnerable to a buffer 
        overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the refclock of ntpd.
        By sending an overly long string, a remote attacker could overflow a
        buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system or cause the 
        application to crash.

    DESCRIPTION: Network Time Protocol (NTP) is vulnerable to a denial of 
        service, caused by ASSERT botch instead of returning FAIL on some 
        invalid values by the decodenetnum() function. An attacker could 
        exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.

            These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar
            file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the
            integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be
            confirmed, contact IBM AIX Security at
            security-alert@austin.ibm.com and describe the discrepancy.

        C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION

            IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
            of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
            readable before proceeding.

            To preview a fix installation:

            installp -a -d fix_name -p all  # where fix_name is the name of the
                                        # fix package being previewed.
            To install a fix package:

            installp -a -d fix_name -X all  # where fix_name is the name of the
                                        # fix package being installed.

            Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression
            testing but not the full regression testing that takes place
            for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

            Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

            http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html

            To preview an interim fix installation:

            emgr -e ipkg_name -p         # where ipkg_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being previewed.

            To install an interim fix package:

            emgr -e ipkg_name -X         # where ipkg_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being installed.

    WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS:

        None.
