This may be the case for files that were stored more than 4 years ago, or for files that have been uploaded in chunks, e.g. during a migration. When synchronizing via OX Drive, the missing checksums for those files are calculated on demand, which requires the files to be retrieved from the underlying storage.

In cases where a large offset to UTC is present, there has been a 50/50 chance that appointments would conflict with full-day appointments at the previous or next day. We&#39;re now calculating both values using the users specific timezone for conflict handling.

The reason for this was a client-specific CalDAV header used to indicate full-day appointments which caused issues with Lightning.

This has been solved by adding an optional parameter as described by Change #4022 to allow base64 encoded transfer. Additionally, unexpected encoding configurations will get logged to <code>open-xchange-console.log</code> to alert operators about potential follow-up issues.</p> <h4 id="50918-timezone-issues-with-task-start-due-dates-on-negative-timezone-offsets"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=50918">50918</a> Timezone issues with task start/due dates on negative timezone offsets</h4> <p>When defining a start or due date for tasks while using a negative UTC offset, the selected date would be reported incorrectly.

When rolling out this Patch Release.</p> <h4 id="51910-optimizing-imap-idle-handling-and-hazelcast-lookups"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51910">51910</a> Optimizing IMAP IDLE handling and Hazelcast lookups</h4> <p>When using IMAP IDLE in larger deployments (which OX does not recommend) it might happen that threads are getting blocked by attempts to look up and close associated push listeners in a cluster once a user closes a session. Using synchonization protocols like Exchange Active Sync triggers many sessions to be opened and closed in a relatively short period of time. While there might be configurations where only one IMAP IDLE push listener per user is allowed, in many cases this level of consistency is excessive and could lead to outages. Therefor we changed the behaviour to only look up &quot;local&quot; sessions rather than querying the whole cluster. This behaviour is configurable and described within release notes. When rolling out this Patch Release please have a close look to IMAP IDLE session count and modify the configuration in accordance to the environments requirements. To enhance overall performance of session lookups, a index has been added to the Hazelcast &quot;sessions&quot; map. As a result, clusters need to be completely updated and restarted when applying this patch release, the &quot;sessions&quot; map is not compatible with its earlier version.</p> <h4 id="51847-enhanced-imap-request-tracking"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51847">51847</a> Enhanced IMAP request tracking</h4> <p>Logging has been extended to allow tracking individual IMAP activities/requests for a OX App Suite session which might use several IMAP connections.

Such situations may arise in specific provisioning implementations.

When adding a new version of the same file but with a different filename in OX Drive, that version will be created as a new file at the storage service and return vague error messages. We solved this by using unique names of additional files when adding a version.

This disabled caching of the response and led to unnecessary resource consumption. The problem has been solved by setting a future (+1 hour) date as value for the <code>expires</code> header.</p> <h4 id="49964-drive-mails-using-main-account-name-instead-of-alias"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49964">49964</a> Drive mails using main account name instead of alias</h4> <p>Display name is always determined by associated user.<para>Now choosing proper full name by given mail address.</p> <h4 id="49958-print-preview-of-mail-is-always-html"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=49958">49958</a> Print preview of mail is always HTML</h4> <p>Despite the users configuration print previews for mails were always using the HTML part of the message.
