<BR>
Original Release Date:  June 28, 2012<BR>
Last Revised:  June 28, 2012<BR>

<!--DocId: 100164021-->
<hr>
<H2>1. Overview:</H2>
<P>Avaya IP Office Customer Call Reporter is a call center reporting application for use with 
IP Office telephone systems.  Customer Call Reporter provides current and historical statistical 
reports on the performance of agents and agent groups.  It was found that certain Web pages 
in the Customer Call Reporter Wallboard application allowed unauthenticated access where a 
user could upload additional files to the server, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution 
under the context of the Web server.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) 
has assigned the name 
<A HREF="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3811">CVE-2012-3811</A> 
to this issue.</P>

<P>Avaya would like to thank the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) for responsibly reporting 
this vulnerability originally identified by Andrea Micalizzi.  
ZDI has disclosed this vulnerability under the name 
<A HREF="http://zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-12-106">ZDI-12-106</A>.  
A listing of disclosed vulnerabilities by ZDI can be found on their

<P><B>Recommended Actions for System Products:</B><BR>Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow 
networking and security best practices by implementing 
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate 
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such 
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya 
products and the surrounding network from this potential 
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these 
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided 
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied. 
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the 
customer's security policies may be required during this 
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product 
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.  
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.</P>

<H3>Mitigating Factors:</H3>
<P>When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as 
outlined by Avaya's 
<A HREF="https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674">
Security Vulnerability Classification Policy</A>. 
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific 
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:</P>

CVE-2012-3811
</TD>
<TD>This is a medium risk due to the fact that potential execution of
arbitrary code loaded by an unauthenticated user would run under the
