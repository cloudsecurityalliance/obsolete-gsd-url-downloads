This got fixed by retaining commented script content which is unknown to the 7.8.4 implementation.</p> <h4 id="54181-config-cascade-inconsistency-for-value-pairs"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54181">54181</a> Config-cascade inconsistency for value pairs</h4> <p>Certain value pairs where not correctly distributed by the config cascade mechanism, especially those related to services that use oAuth for authentication. We solved this by making those properties config-cascade aware.</p> <h4 id="54136-incorrect-permission-restriction-when-moving-folders-in-drive"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54136">54136</a> Incorrect permission restriction when moving folders in Drive</h4> <p>When moving/copying a folder from a external storage service to folder of the primary OX Drive storage service, a permission related error was thrown. This got solved by properly setting administrator privileges to the creator of a OX Drive folder while copying/moving in folders from external services.</p> <h4 id="54133-sharing-dialog-stuck-when-sharing-locked-file"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54133">54133</a> Sharing dialog stuck when sharing locked file</h4> <p>When attempting to share a file which is locked, the sharing dialog did not close when canceling the operation. This got solved by handling potential errors related to locks when trying to share a file.</p> <h4 id="54069-fuzzy-fallback-for-unsupported-languages"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54069">54069</a> Fuzzy fallback for unsupported languages</h4> <p>In certain cases the frontend language did fall back to german instead of english. This got fixed by setting a explicit fallback to en_US if the browser provides a unsupported language and no previously set OX language cookie.</p> <h4 id="54067-outdated-unsupported-browsers-message"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54067">54067</a> Outdated &quot;unsupported browsers&quot; message</h4> <p>OX App Suite UI did display incorrect recommendations for mobile browsers when using such as a desktop browser. This has been solved and we&#39;re now showing recommendations for mobile browsers only when using a mobile device.</p> <h4 id="54042-unable-to-update-dates-with-japanese-locale"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54042">54042</a> Unable to update dates with Japanese locale</h4> <p>When defining start/end dates at the calendar on mobile browsers, the supplied data did not get taken over to the appointment. This was caused by incompatibility of a date/time format library with specific languages and has been fixed by making sure the same date/time format is used at all related components.</p> <h4 id="54041-missing-schema-information-for-database-timeout-errors"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54041">54041</a> Missing schema information for database timeout errors</h4> <p>In case a database connection reported a communication failure or timeout, the specific database schema was not part of the exception. This has now been added to allow simple debugging of affected database clusters.</p> <h4 id="54034-missing-recipient-when-removing-and-modifying-recipients"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54034">54034</a> Missing recipient when removing and modifying recipients</h4> <p>In cases where the original recipients (To, Cc) of a mail got removed during compose and re-added later, the resulting mail was sent without recipient information. This got fixed by properly handling events related to tokens that display participants.</p> <h4 id="53980-high-cpu-load-caused-by-documentconverter"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53980">53980</a> High CPU load caused by documentconverter</h4> <p>Changes to documentconverter led to higher than usual base CPU load. This impact got reduced by lowering a queue polling time to a value which offers a good compromise between queue responsiveness and &quot;idle&quot; CPU load.</p> <h4 id="53958-more-debug-background-for-exceptions-related-to-closed-imap-folders"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53958">53958</a> More debug background for exceptions related to closed IMAP folders</h4> <p>In case a IMAP backend did close a connection due to technical issues or timeouts, the resulting stack-trace at OX App Suite middleware was rather generic. This has been improved in a way that we now show the related IMAP command to allow better debugging. This issue has to be validated in production environments that show such unexpected behavior.</p> <h4 id="53923-quick-reply-disappears-after-the-first-reply"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53923">53923</a> Quick reply disappears after the first reply</h4> <p>When using &quot;quick reply&quot; to answer a mail, this option will disappear. We changed the behavior in a way that the option stays available after using it.</p> <h4 id="53916-adding-local-files-opens-camera-app-on-ios"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53916">53916</a> Adding local files opens camera App on iOS</h4> <p>When using OX App Suite UI with Safari on iOS, the action to add a local attachment resulted in immediate launch of the camera App. We now trigger a selection menu which offers to either use the camera or access existing photos on the device.</p> <h4 id="53913-vacation-notices-could-not-be-activated-for-aliases"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53913">53913</a> Vacation notices could not be activated for aliases</h4> <p>When setting a vacation notice, it was not possible to define a alias address for the notice instead of the primary address. This got fixed by more consistent checks for mail aliases.</p> <h4 id="53688-contacts-with-katakana-yomi-fields-were-sorted-as-other"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53688">53688</a> Contacts with Katakana &quot;yomi&quot; fields were sorted as &quot;other&quot;</h4> <p>When using Japanese language settings and subsequently &quot;yomi&quot; contact fields, those contacts were sorted incorrectly as &quot;other&quot;, which got solved.</p> <h4 id="53671-specific-mails-produced-empty-printouts"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53671">53671</a> Specific mails produced empty printouts</h4> <p>When printing specific mails that define CSS, the created print version did not show substantial content. This got fixed by dropping certain CSS elements from our whitelist that could lead to broken layouts. See Change #4204.</p> <h4 id="53649-folder-ids-were-shown-in-pim-objects-attachment-details"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53649">53649</a> Folder IDs were shown in PIM objects attachment details</h4> <p>For PIM objects with attachments we did show the hyperlinks pointing to OX Drive instead of the corresponding App. To avoid confusion we did visually remove those links as they provide almost no functionality.</p> <h4 id="53474-duplicate-recipients-when-sending-mail"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53474">53474</a> Duplicate recipients when sending mail</h4> <p>When sending a mail to all appointment participants the resulting mail compose did contain duplicates of the expected recipients. This got solved by detecting and removing the currently logged in user from that list.</p> <h4 id="53437-inconsistency-for-thumbnails-and-image-preview"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53437">53437</a> Inconsistency for thumbnails and image preview</h4> <p>Certain file formats (tiff, psd, pbm) were shown as thumbnail preview while not being supported in image preview. To ensure consistency we added support for tiff and psd files to image preview.</p> <h4 id="53313-unable-to-edit-name-used-for-mail-on-mobile"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53313">53313</a> Unable to edit name used for mail on mobile</h4> <p>When using OX App Suite UI on a mobile browser, updates to a E-Mail addresses &quot;personal part&quot; at mail compose were not reflected to the selected mail address. This got solved by updating the corresponding element after the change has happened.</p> <h2 id="patch-release-4180-2017-06-14"><a name="4180"></a>Patch Release 4180 (2017-06-14)</h2> <h3 id="shipped-components-and-versions">Shipped Components and Versions</h3> <ul> <li>Open-Xchange AppSuite backend 7.8.4-rev4</li> <li>Open-Xchange AppSuite frontend 7.8.4-rev4</li> <li>Open-Xchange EAS 7.8.4-rev4</li> </ul> <h3 id="fixed-bugs">Fixed Bugs</h3> <h4 id="53900-1st-out-of-two-google-mail-account-does-not-work-after-adding-2nd-out-of-two-google-calender-abo"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53900">53900</a> 1st (out of two) Google Mail Account does not work after adding 2nd (out of two) Google Calender Abo</h4> <p>When updating an OAuth account (applying a new name), the enabled scopes was accidentally reseted.<para>This has been solved by not touching OAuth account&#39;s enabled scopes when updating its name.</p> <h4 id="53795-pop3-external-account-messages-retrieved-are-duplicated"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53795">53795</a> POP3 External account: messages retrieved are duplicated</h4> <p>Certain POP3 server&#39;s do not obey to advertise UIDLs with at max. 70 characters.<para>This has been fixed by extending the &quot;uidl&quot; column in &quot;pop3_storage_ids&quot; and &quot;pop3_storage_deleted&quot; tables from 70 to 128 characters as some POP3 server advertise bigger UIDL values. An Updatetask will be triggered with this fix.</p> <h4 id="53690-fields-considered-for-sorting-categorizing-contacts-inconsistent"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53690">53690</a> Fields considered for sorting / categorizing contacts inconsistent</h4> <p>A contact&#39;s (yomi-) firstname was not taken into account during sort name generation in case no (yomi-) lastname was set.<para>This has been solved by using combination of (yomi-) last- and firstname per default as sort name.</p> <h4 id="53689-yomi-fields-not-available-visible-with-non-japanese-language-setting"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53689">53689</a> Yomi fields not available / visible with non-Japanese language setting</h4> <p>Missing feature for other languages.<para>Added new setting and feature to make yomi fields with other languages.</p> <h4 id="53688-contacts-with-katakana-yomi-fields-are-sorted-and-categorized-as-other"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53688">53688</a> Contacts with Katakana &quot;yomi&quot; fields are sorted and categorized as &quot;other&quot;</h4> <p>Only hiragana in sorting table.<para>Extend table with katakana to solve the first part.

As a result the displayname could not be changed. We solved this by applying the appropriate host name to avoid erroneous responses during the operation.</p> <h4 id="52119-technical-messages-if-html-mail-exceeds-limits"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52119">52119</a> Technical messages if HTML mail exceeds limits</h4> <p>If a HTML mail exceeds pre-defined limits, a rather harsh message is displayed at the frontend.

The favorite folder for drive has the parent with id &quot;9&quot;. When the UI is refreshed, all parents of all folders are listed. That causes every refresh to request the folder with id &quot;9&quot;.<para>This has been fixed by only adding favorite folders for modules with granted permission.</p> <h4 id="52100-permission-checks-avoid-changing-corrupt-users-signatures"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=52100">52100</a> Permission checks avoid changing corrupt users signatures</h4> <p>In case a users signature contains a faulty &quot;createdby&quot; header on file-level, subsequent changes to that signature were rejected based on a permission evaluation.

This behavior is configurable and described within release notes. When rolling out this Patch Release.</p> <h4 id="51967-missing-distribution-lists-in-outlook"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51967">51967</a> Missing distribution lists in Outlook</h4> <p>When syncing Outlook using USM, certain amounts and combinations of contacts and distribution lists could lead to a situation where only a subset of contacts but not all distribution lists got synced. This has been solved by sorting the type of object (contact, distribution list) prior to performing the sync operation. This way the kind of objects retrieved at the client side stays consistent in case the total amount of objects exceeds the chunk size for one sync operation.</p> <h4 id="51960-incorrect-font-for-mail-attachment-on-mobile"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51960">51960</a> Incorrect font for mail attachment on mobile</h4> <p>When using OX App Suite UI on a smartphone, the &quot;Attachments&quot; link within mail compose has been shown with incorrect font and color.

In cases where a large offset to UTC is present, there has been a 50/50 chance that appointments would conflict with full-day appointments at the previous or next day. We&#39;re now calculating both values using the users specific timezone for conflict handling.

While OX clients were unaffected, this led to an incompatibility with third-party clients when using the &quot;infostore&quot; API for uploading and modifying files. We reduced the scope of the change to block MIME-Types that start with &quot;multipart&quot; instead, this should not affect the vast majority of use-cases for this API.</p> <h4 id="51839-certain-serious-non-uce-ube-html-mail-is-not-displayed"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51839">51839</a> Certain serious (non UCE/UBE) HTML mail is not displayed</h4> <p>Too greedy check for possibly malicious content led to this issue.<para>This has been solved by allowing properly parsed start tag.</p> <h4 id="51772-unable-to-modify-users-own-data"><a href="https://bugs.open-xchange.com/show_bug.cgi?id=51772">51772</a> Unable to modify users own data</h4> <p>In cases where the contact associated to the user account was created by the &quot;oxadmin&quot; account rather than the user itself, the user was unable to change its own contact data.
