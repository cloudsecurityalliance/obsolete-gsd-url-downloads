        <!--<br><p>This is a teeny-tiny release (that’s why it is numbered like a hotfix).
It does fix a recent regression in the <em>partition</em> module, where
a pop-up message asks you to create a gargantuan EFI partition.
The message is supposed to say “300 MiB”, but expresses 300 MiB in bytes,
so it’s off by a factor of a million (more, even).</p>

The Calamares project has participated <a href="/calamares-hacktoberfest/">before</a>
and we’ve seen some small benefits from it. This year, the rules have
tightened to be stricter on spam pull-requests (in 2020 we got a couple),
and I’m glad of that. Potential contributors can check out the
<a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ahacktoberfest">list of good starter-issues</a>.
Most of those issues have a checklist to help new folks along.
The checklist should take you from “get Calamares to run at all” through to “submit a PR that can be merged”.</p>

        <!--<br><p>Another day, another typo in Python modules. Several of them,
even, on code paths that apparently – and fortunately – nobody
is using. The release scripts now run <em>pylint</em> as part of
the release process to check for obvious problems. Those problems
should have been obvious – with enough eyes on them anyway –
before, but now the machine does part of the looking for us.</p>

important for certain distributions, and have no effect on others.
And then, after a few hours, a hot-fix release for a typo
introduced as “internal code fix”. So enjoy Calamares 3.2.44.1.
We’ll be looking into integrating better tools to avoid typo’s
in Python modules in upcoming releases.</p>

        <!--<br><p>This release has remarkably little user-visible change in it,
<strong>unless</strong> you are looking for better translation coverage,
for instance when starting Calamares in Russian and switching to
Chinese. For your typing please, the <em>keyboardq</em> module (used
by KaOS) now offers keyboard layout previews.</p>

        <!--<br><p>After a summer break, we return to short-cycle releases
where the Calamares team does a release roughly every two weeks
with the bugfixes and improvements from that time.
The Calamares team is happy to
release Calamares 3.2.42. The milestone remains open,
but this release has bugfixes for keyboard and partitioning
and new features in the welcome, summary and packagechooser modules,
as well as other areas.</p>

        <li><a href="/summer/">Calamares Summer 2021</a></li>

August: vacation and other meetings mean that there are
<strong>no</strong> short-cycle releases expected until early September.
Development will pick up as usual at the end of August.
In the meantime, things are in the capable hands of
Calamares-using distributions like KaOS, Manjaro, and ArcoLinux.</p>

        <!--<br><p>Calamares 3.2.41.1 has been released. This is a <strong>hot-fix</strong> release for
a regression in the partitioning module. Calamares crashes on startup
if certain partitioning conditions are met. Reported by KDE neon users.</p>

        <!--<br><p>Returning to short-cycle releases, the Calamares team is happy to
release Calamares 3.2.41. The “things that fit” into this release
do not cover all of the items on the milestone, which will remain
open for a few more releases until all the milestone issues are
resolved.</p>

 -->
    
        <li><a href="/calamares-3.2.40-is-out/">Calamares 3.2.40 released</a></li>
        <!--<br><p>If it doesn’t rain, things dry up. Calamares 3.2.40 took
too long to get out the door, largely a consequence of
having a number of big-ticket things on the milestone
along with lots of little fiddly bits.</p>

<p>As a 3-months-long-release, this one has many more changes
than the short-cycle releases from earlier in the 3.2 series.
We expect to return to short-cycle – simply because that
works better. We have several new contributors who helped
to improve Calamares.</p>

 -->
    
        <li><a href="/communications2/">Communications Channels Again</a></li>
        <!--<br><p>Calamares, like many Free Software projects, has been
using IRC for many years for real-time communication, for idle chit-chat and 
for community-building. We now <strong>primarily</strong> use <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#calamares:kde.org</code>)
and <strong>secondarily</strong> the <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.Chat</a> IRC network (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#calamares</code>).
The Freenode channel that was the chatroom of the project from its
start in 2014 is no longer controlled, operated, or monitored by
the Calamares team.</p>

        <li><a href="/welcome/">New Faces</a></li>
        <!--<br><p>Calamares serves the needs of several dozen Linux distributions,
large and small, based on any one of the “big five” distro’s, with
whatever desktop environment users would like. Two new faces
(both Arch-derivatives) have joined the club this month, so let’s give them a bit
of spotlight.</p>

 -->
    
        <li><a href="/communications/">Communications Channels</a></li>
        <!--<br><p>Calamares, like many Free Software projects, has been
using IRC – and the Freenode network – for many years
for real-time communication, for idle chit-chat and

has encouraged the Calamares team to diversify the communication
channels.</p>

        <!--<br><p>This season – january to april, so that’s winter-and-early-spring season
for me but probably other seasons elsewhere in the world –
Calamares participated in <a href="https://season.kde.org/">Season of KDE</a>,
which is a participate-in-KDE activity. While Calamares is not a
KDE project, there is enough KDE code used <em>by</em> Calamares to call
it KDE-adjacent, and so we tagged along.</p>

        <!--<br><p>A minor bugfix tweak release. Since this contains yet <strong>another</strong>
autologin-related fix, and there is nothing large enough to justify
a 3.2.40 release yet, add it to the growing tail of 3.2.39. (Reported
by Joe Kamprad, #1672). Also fixes a regression from 3.2.28 in
localized packages (e.g. <em>package-LOCALE</em> did not work).</p>

a mismatch between the <em>users</em> module and the <em>displaymanager</em> module
prevents autologin from being configured. The list of (partly)
supported desktop environments for <em>displaymanager</em> has been expanded as well.
Improvements supplied by, and bug reports from, Erik Dubois. Thank you!</p>

here’s another quick-release of Calamares. Note that <em>btrfs</em> support
is relatively new and has a number of open issues with it.</p>

that something mentioned in the changelog was not included in
the released tarball. So we get a new release,
<strong>with</strong> all the bits promised for 3.2.38 and some
translation updates and minor bugfixes to boot.</p>

you pick whichever one you like) there is Calamares 3.2.38.
There are new modules, module improvements, and some under-the-hood
fixes. The milestone for 3.2.37 still isn’t empty, so we will keep
using that until it’s done.</p>

second release that does not add a whole lot, but let’s get it out
the door anyway. It is feature-light, although users in Belarus

reuse the current milestone.</p>

system for many years. The combination of quick builds, easily configured,
and good IRC notifications have been useful to the team and the Open Source
ecosystem. However, Travis-CI is reducing the amount of service it
provides (for free!) to Open Source projects, so Calamares is moving
its CI elsewhere.</p>
