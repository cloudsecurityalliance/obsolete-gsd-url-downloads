libtiff security update (RHSA-2012-0468)<BR>
<BR>
Original Release Date:  May 8, 2012<BR>
Last Revised: July 7, 2015<BR>
Number:  ASA-2012-209<BR>
Risk Level: Low<BR>
Advisory Version:  5.0<BR>
Advisory Status:  Final<BR>
<!--DocId: 100161772-->
<hr>
<H2>1. Overview:</H2>
<P>The libtiff packages contain a library of functions for manipulating Tagged
Image File Format (TIFF) files.</P>
<P>Two integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows, were
found in the way libtiff attempted to allocate space for a tile in a TIFF
image file. An attacker could use these flaws to create a specially-crafted
TIFF file that, when opened, would cause an application linked against
libtiff to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name <A HREF=
"https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2012-1173.html"
>CVE-2012-1173</A> to this issue.</P>
<P>More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:</P>

</H2>
<P><B>Recommended Actions for System Products:</B><BR>Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow 
networking and security best practices by implementing 
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate 
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such 
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya 
products and the surrounding network from this potential 
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these 
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided 
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied. 
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the 
customer's security policies may be required during this 
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product 
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.  
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.</P>

<H3>Mitigating Factors:</H3>
<P>When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as 
outlined by Avaya's 
<A HREF="https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674">
Security Vulnerability Classification Policy</A>. 
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific 
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:</P>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>
<TH WIDTH=120 ALIGN=left>Vulnerability</TH>
<TH ALIGN=left>Mitigating Factors</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=120>
CVE-2012-1173<BR>
</TD>
<TD>The risk is Low for all products because only TIFF files distributed as part of the product would be opened. Modifying a product TIFF file would require action by a privileged user.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>3. Avaya Software-Only Products:</H2>
<P>Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems. 
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or 
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not 
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the 
underlying platform.</P>
<P>In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the 
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should 
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow 
that vendor's guidance.</P>
