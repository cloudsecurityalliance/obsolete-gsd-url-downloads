<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently asked questions (FAQ) related to this security update</h2>
<p><strong>Why was this security bulletin updated on December 14, 2004?</strong><br/>
The bulletin has been updated to advise on the availability of additional updates that help address this vulnerability:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standalone security updates for the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0 Service Pack 2 and the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.1 are now available. Based on customer feedback, Microsoft has created standalone updates for customers who have not yet deployed the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 Service Pack 3 or the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1. However, Microsoft recommends that customers install the latest service pack in order to receive protection from this vulnerability as well as other security related issues. Customers that have already installed the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0 Service Pack 3 or the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.1 Service Pack 1 do not need to apply these additional security updates.</li>
<li>Security updates for Microsoft Visual FoxPro 8.0 are now available. Developers should use the update for Microsoft Visual FoxPro 8.0 to update their development environment. Developers distributing custom runtime applications that were developed using Microsoft Visual FoxPro 8.0 and include a copy of the vulnerable gdiplus.dll file should evaluate the need to deploy the security update for the Microsoft Visual FoxPro 8.0 Runtime Library.</li>
<li>Windows Messenger 5.0 distributes a copy of the vulnerable version of the gdiplus.dll file. However, it is not vulnerable to any known or likely attack vectors and therefore is not considered to be vulnerable to this issue. However, customers that are concerned about the presence of this file and possible future attack vectors that may be found should upgrade to Windows Messenger 5.1. Windows Messenger 5.1 contains the latest version of the gdiplus.dll file and is the recommended version of Windows Messenger. Windows Messenger 5.1 can be downloaded from the following <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=a8d9eb73-5f8c-4b9a-940f-9157a3b3d774" data-linktype="external">Web site.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The MS04-028 Enterprise Update Scanning Tool has been updated to detect and deploy the stand alone security updates for the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0 Service Pack 2 and the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.1 as well as the Microsoft Visual FoxPro 8.0 security update. The existing version of this tool supported the detection and deployment of the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.0 Service Pack 3 and the Microsoft .NET Framework version 1.1 Service Pack 1. Now that the standalone security updates are available this tool has been updated to use the stand alone updates instead of the service pack updates. Customers who prefer the support of the service pack updates should continue to use the existing version of this tool. Since Windows Messenger is not considered to be vulnerable to any known or likely attack vectors, it has not been included in this update. For more information about the MS04-028 Enterprise Update Scanning Tool, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?id=886988" data-linktype="external">886988</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why was this security bulletin updated on October 12, 2004?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;833987" data-linktype="external">833987</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;833987" data-linktype="external">833987</a></p>
<p>After the release of the MS04-028 security bulletin, Microsoft became aware of an issue affecting customers deploying the Office XP, Visio 2002, and Project 2002 updates on Windows XP Service Pack 2 based systems. In some cases, this issue caused the security updates to appear to install correctly, when in fact they did not. This is an issue with the installer used in the security update. For more technical details on this issue, and the specific conditions that can cause the installation to fail, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;885876" data-linktype="external">885876</a>.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Windows XP Service Pack 2 already contains the security update addressing the vulnerability in the JPEG Parsing Engine that is supplied by the operating system. However, customers still need to successfully apply the security updates for Office XP, Visio 2002, and Project 2002 in order to be protected from this vulnerability when using these applications.</p>
<p>Microsoft has investigated this issue and has made available revised security updates for these applications to help ensure that they install successfully on Windows XP Service Pack 2 based systems. These revised security updates are available from Office Update and the Microsoft Download Center. Customers who have not yet applied the original version of these updates should visit Office Update to receive the revised updates. Enterprise customers who have not yet applied the original version of these update should obtain the revised updates from the Microsoft Download Center by using the download links provided in the Affected Software section of this security bulletin.</p>
<p>For customers who have already applied the original Office XP, Visio 2002, and Project 2002 updates and are using Windows XP Service Pack 2, any one of the following steps will correct the issue and properly apply the update:</p>
<ul>
<li>For customers who have Automatic Update enabled in Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft has provided an updated installation package through Windows Update that will correct the installation problem and install the correct files. Since Windows XP Service Pack 2 recommends and prompts customers to turn Automatic Update on, most Windows XP Service Pack 2 users will not have to take any additional steps. This updated installation package is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;885884" data-linktype="external">885884</a>.</li>
<li>Visit Office Update to obtain the revised updates. Office update will detect the vulnerability on the system and apply the update with the revised version of the installer software.</li>
<li>Enterprise customers should obtain the revised security updates from the Microsoft Download Center and redeploy these updates to their clients running Windows XP Service Pack 2.</li>
<li>Customers can use the “Detect and Repair” feature within the affected applications. This process will successfully install the correct version of the affected files needed to help protect against the vulnerability. For more information about manually using the &quot;Detect and Repair&quot; feature, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=821593" data-linktype="external">821593</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft has also identified the Windows Journal Viewer as affected by this security vulnerability and has released an update for Windows 2000-based systems. See the following FAQs for more information about the update for the Windows Journal Viewer for Windows 2000-based systems.</p>
<p>As part of this update, Microsoft has also released the MS04-028 Enterprise Update Scanning Tool. Review the MS04-028 Enterprise Update Scanning Tool FAQ in this updated security bulletin for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Why has Microsoft released an update for the Windows Journal Viewer on October 12, 2004?</strong><br/>
The Windows Journal Viewer makes it possible for users who do not have a system running Windows XP Tablet PC Edition to view files that were created in Windows Journal on a Tablet PC. The Windows Journal Viewer is vulnerable to the security vulnerability discussed in this bulletin. However, when used on Windows XP based systems, the Windows Journal Viewer uses the operating system supplied version of the affected component. When the Windows XP operating system update is applied on Windows XP and Windows XP Service Pack 1 based systems the Windows Journal Viewer is no longer vulnerable to this issue. Windows XP Service Pack 2 is not vulnerable to this issue, therefore the Windows Journal Viewer when used on Windows XP Service Pack 2 based systems is not vulnerable to this issue. We have now released a security update for Windows Journal Viewer that will help protect Windows 2000-based systems that may have installed the Windows Journal Viewer.</p>
<p>Even if you have installed all of the previously available security updates on Windows 2000, if you have installed the Windows Journal Viewer, it is important that you also install this security update. Windows Update will offer this update only to Windows 2000-based systems that have installed the Windows Journal Viewer. If you are using Windows XP or have not installed the Windows Journal Viewer on Windows 2000, you do not need this security update. This program is not supported on Windows Server 2003. However, if it were installed on Windows Server 2003, it would also use the operating system version of the vulnerable component. If you are using this program on Windows Server 2003 make sure that you install the Windows Server 2003 security update.</p>
<p><strong>What is GDI+?</strong><br/>
GDI+ is a graphics device interface that provides two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography to applications and programmers.</p>
<p><strong>Why are there several affected programs and components?</strong><br/>
Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 provide an operating system version of the component that is vulnerable to this issue. Earlier versions of Windows did not provide an operating system version of this component. Therefore, when you install programs that require this functionality on earlier versions of Windows, this component is commonly installed. Typically, when these programs are installed on Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2003 they only use the version that is provided by the operating system, even if they install a copy of the vulnerable component.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are Office XP, Visio 2002, Project 2002, Office 2003, Visio 2003, and Project 2003. To help make sure that JPEG images are processed consistently across all operating systems, these programs use their own version of the vulnerable component. This version of the vulnerable component is installed on all operating systems that are supported by these programs. If you have installed these programs, you must install the update for these programs. You must also install an operating system update if you use Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2003. Also, please review the following FAQ questions relating to exceptions for application developers and third-party applications.</p>
<p><strong>If I use Windows XP Service Pack 2 and use any of the affected software, what should I do?</strong><br/>
Windows XP Service Pack 2 does not contain a vulnerable version of the affected component. However, if you have installed any of the affected Office, Visio, or Project applications you should install the updates for those applications. The easiest way to address this vulnerability is to install the updates provided by <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21135" data-linktype="external">Office Update</a>. If you have not installed any of the affected Office, Visio, or Project applications you do not have to install any other security updates because the other affected software and affected components use the operating system version of the vulnerable component on Windows XP Service Pack 2. However, please review the following FAQ questions relating to exceptions for application developers and third-party applications. Also, as explained in the previous FAQ, there are cases when the original versions of the Office, Visio, and Project security updates may not have installed correctly. For more information, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;833987" data-linktype="external">833987</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If I use Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2003 and use any of the affected software, what should I do?</strong><br/>
If you have installed any of the affected Office, Visio, or Project applications the easiest way to address this vulnerability is to install the updates provided by both <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130" data-linktype="external">Windows Update</a> and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21135" data-linktype="external">Office Update</a>. If you have not installed any of the affected Office, Visio, or Project applications the easiest way to address this vulnerability is to install the updates provided by <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130" data-linktype="external">Windows Update</a>. You do not have to install any other security updates because the other affected software and affected components use the operating system version of the component on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. However, please review the following FAQ questions relating to exceptions for application developers and third-party applications.</p>
<p><strong>If I use Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition (SE), Windows Millennium Edition (Me), Windows NT 4.0, or Windows 2000, what should I do?</strong><br/>
By default, these operating systems do not natively provide a version of the vulnerable component and are not affected. However, the vulnerable component is installed on these non-affected operating systems when you install any of the software programs or components that are listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components sections of this bulletin.</p>
<p>If you have installed any of the affected programs or components, you should install the required security updates for those programs or components. For example, if you have Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 and Office XP installed on your Windows 2000 system, you have to install the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 security update and the Office XP security update. If you have not installed any of the affected programs or components, you do not have to install any security updates.</p>
<p><strong>If I use versions of Internet Explorer that are earlier than Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, am I vulnerable to this issue?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 3, Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 on Windows 2000, and Internet Explorer 5.5 Service Pack 2 on Windows Me have been tested and they are not vulnerable.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 6 is only supported when using Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003. Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 uses the operating system version of the vulnerable component. When the Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 operating system update is installed, Internet Explorer 6 is not vulnerable. Windows XP Service Pack 2 includes Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 2 and is not vulnerable to this issue. Internet Explorer 6 is no longer in support on other operating systems and may be vulnerable to this issue on those operating systems. Customers who do not use Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2003 and who use versions of Internet Explorer 6 that are earlier than Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 should upgrade to Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 and then install the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 security update provided in this security bulletin, or upgrade to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2/default.mspx" data-linktype="external">Windows XP Service Pack 2</a> for Windows XP customers. To install Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, visit the following <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/downloads/critical/ie6sp1/default.mspx" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. For more information about the support lifecycle for Internet Explorer, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If I use third-party applications that distribute the gdiplus.dll file, could I still be vulnerable even after I have installed all required Microsoft security updates?</strong><br/>
Yes. There are cases where you might be vulnerable to this issue even after you install the required operating system update and the updates for programs or components that are listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components sections of this bulletin.
If the Gdiplus.dll file is installed on your system, you may have to install an update for that program. Not every program that installs this file is vulnerable to this issue because it may not use the Gdiplus.dll file to process JPEG images. Even when the third-party application uses the Gdiplus.dll file to process JPEG images it may not do so in a vulnerable way. For example if an application does not allow users to supply images for processing or performs additional validation on the images before processing, it may not be vulnerable. However, only the manufacturer of that program can make that determination. This could include, but is not limited to, third party applications that were developed using Visual Studio .NET 2002, Visual Studio .NET 2003, or the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 SDK Service Pack 2.
Additionally, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 provide additional methods to help secure applications. These operating systems provide an operating system version of the affected component and can be centrally protected. This means that even if an application installs a version of the Gdiplus.dll file, that the application in most cases will use the operating system supplied version. The operating system version of Gdiplus.dll is updated when you install the appropriate operating system update and will protect most applications from this vulnerability.</p>
<p>However, it is possible for a developer or administrator to force an application to bypass the operating system supplied version of the Gdiplus.dll file and instead use a version that they supply. There are several ways that an application developer may design their application to not use the operating system version of the component. They might explicitly call a version of the component that they have provided, or they might use a side by side bypass feature to call their version of the affected component. This is not likely to be used in most circumstances. However, you may want to consider contacting the third-party application manufacturer for an updated version of their program, if they verify that their program uses any type of bypass feature. Steps to determine if your application is using the side by side bypass feature are located in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;835322" data-linktype="external">835322</a>. To determine if your applications has explicitly called a version of the component that they supply we recommend that you contact the application manufacturer. It is important to note that the use of these types of features is generally rare and not recommended. For more information, see the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms995328" data-linktype="external">MSDN Web site</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, in these cases you would only be vulnerable to this issue while using the affected program to process images. Installing the operating system update and the updates for the affected programs and components listed in this bulletin will help reduce the chance that you will be attacked from the most common attack vectors an attacker could use to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that you should install any available security updates instead of manually updating the affected component, if possible. Manually updating the affected component could create application compatibility issues and is not supported. Also, applications that feature ‘Detect and Repair’ functionality will not receive the necessary information required to prevent these features from potentially introducing the vulnerability upon execution if the affected component is manually updated.</p>
<p><strong>If I am a developer and use Visual Studio .NET 2002, Visual Studio .NET 2003, the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 SDK Service Pack 2, or the Microsoft Platform SDK Redistributable: GDI+ to develop applications, what should I do?</strong></p>
<p>When these programs are installed on Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2003 they use the operating system version of the vulnerable component. If you are using these programs on Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, or Windows Server 2003 make sure that you install the operating system version of the security update. If you are using these programs on other operating systems make sure that you install the update for these programs.</p>
<p>However, if you use these programs to create applications that distribute a version of the Gdiplus.dll file you need to install the appropriate security update based on the development tool you use, even if you have installed an available operating system update or are using Windows XP Service Pack 2. If you use the Gdiplus.dll file for JPEG processing you should consider updating your application to use the updated version of the Gdiplus.dll file. However as mentioned in the previous FAQ, your application may not be directly vulnerable to this issue. Also, you should make sure that you are not using any of the bypass features mentioned in the previous FAQ that could create vulnerabilities within your application.</p>
<p><strong>Can I manually script and deploy the required security updates?</strong><br/>
Yes. We have released Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=885885" data-linktype="external">885885</a> to assist with the manual installation of some of the available security updates. This article does not provide instructions for the installation of all available security updates and is provided only as a guide in the creation of custom scripts.</p>
<p><strong>Why was the security update for the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 and the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 initially provided in a Service Pack?</strong></p>
<p>This issue does not affect customers who have already deployed the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 Service pack 3 (SP3) and the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 (SP1). These service packs, released prior to the release of this security bulletin, already contain the security update for this issue as well as other security changes for all reported customer issues found after the release of these software components. Therefore, we highly recommended that customers using the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 or the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 install these Service Packs for increased security not only for this vulnerability but also for all reported customer issues found after the release of the Microsoft .NET Framework.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?</strong><br/>
MBSA does detect if the update for this vulnerability is required for Office XP, Office 2003, Project 2002, Project 2003, Visio 2002, and Visio 2003 for local computer scans. For detailed information about how MBSA detects Office updates, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19025" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. MBSA displays a note to indicate that certain operating system updates are required. MBSA does not currently support the detection of several of the programs that are listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components section of this security bulletin. For detailed information about the programs that MBSA currently does not detect, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;306460" data-linktype="external">306460</a>. If you have installed any of the programs that are listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components section of this security bulletin you may have to manually determine if you have to install the required update. For example, a Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0 system that has installed Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 will need to install the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 security update and MBSA will not detect the missing update in these configurations. Also, MBSA cannot use the Office Detection Tool to scan remote systems, it will only use this tool to scan a system locally for required security updates. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">MBSA Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">MBSA Web site</a>. For more information about MBSA support, visit the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</a><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsaqa.mspx" data-linktype="external">1.2 Q&amp;A Web site</a></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?</strong><br/>
Yes. SMS can help detect and deploy this security update. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>. SMS uses MBSA for detection; therefore, SMS has the same limitation listed earlier in this bulletin related to programs that MBSA does not detect. However, SMS can also use the Microsoft Office Inventory Tool to detect for required updates for Microsoft Office components.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use SMS to determine if programs are installed that have to be updated?</strong><br/>
Yes. SMS can help detect if any of the affected programs or affected components are installed that may have installed a version of the vulnerable component. SMS can search for the existence of the file Gdiplus.dll. For the affected programs and components listed in this bulletin may need to update all versions of Gdiplus.dll that are earlier than version 5.1.3102.1355 or versions that are identified as vulnerable in the following FAQ’s that are in use by affected applications. See the ‘If I use third-party applications that distribute the gdiplus.dll file, could I still be vulnerable even after I have installed all required Microsoft security updates?’ FAQ in this bulletin for more information about other applications that may have installed the Gdiplus.dll file.
However, it is important to note that you should install the available security updates instead of manually updating the affected component. Manually updating the affected component could create application compatibility issues and is not supported. Also, applications that feature ‘Detect and Repair’ functionality will not receive the necessary information required to prevent these features from potentially introducing the vulnerability upon execution if the affected component is manually updated.</p>
<p>Installations of Office XP, Visio 2002, Project 2002, and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (SP1) combine the features of the vulnerable component with other files. For Office XP and Project 2002 you would also have to search for the existence of the Mso.dll file. Update versions of Mso.dll that are earlier than version 10.0.6714.0 that are in use by affected applications. For Visio 2002, you have to search for the existence of the Mso.dll file and the Gdiplus.dll file because Visio 2002 distributes both files, except on Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 where it only distributes the Mso.dll file.</p>
<p>For installations of Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 that are not running on the Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 operating systems, search for the Vgx.dll file. Update all versions of Vgx.dll that are earlier than version 6.0.2800.1411. Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 uses the operating system version of the vulnerable component on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. You do not have to update Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 for those operating systems. These .dll files are documented in the Security Update Information section of this security bulletin. You can also deploy the updates provided in this bulletin using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/patchupdate.mspx" data-linktype="external">Inventory and Software Distribution</a> feature of SMS.</p>
<p><strong>Which versions of the Gdiplus.dll file could cause applications to become vulnerable?</strong><br/>
It is important to remember that the existence of the Gdiplus.dll file does not determine if an application is vulnerable to this issue. The previous FAQs can be used to help determine if you are using the Gdiplus.dll file as part of a vulnerable application. As a general guide to help administrators and developers determine if they are using a version of the Gdiplus.dll file that could allow their applications to become vulnerable to this issue, we have created the following Gdiplus.dll file information table.</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft has released the MS04-028 Enterprise Update Scanning Tool that will assist enterprise customers in detecting if they are running one or more affected products and components, and help them deploy the available security updates. Where can I get more information about this tool?</strong><br/>
In an effort to further support enterprise customers through the unique deployment complexities of MS04-28, due to the number of products and components affected, Microsoft has released a scanning tool and guidance that offers system administrators the ability to scan computers on their network for the software listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components sections of this security bulletin and to automatically apply the appropriate MS04-028 updates. The tool can also be used in conjunction with Microsoft’s System Management Server (SMS). For more information about the MS04-028 Enterprise Update Scanning Tool, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?id=886988" data-linktype="external">886988</a>. This tool does support the Windows Journal Viewer security update.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft has released the GDI+ Detection Tool for consumers that will also assist in detecting if you are running one or more affected products and components. Where can I get more information about this tool?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has created the GDI+ Detection tool to assist consumers in detecting if they are running one or more affected versions of the software listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components sections of this security bulletin that contain a vulnerable version of the JPEG Parsing component on their system. Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;873374" data-linktype="external">873374</a> describes this tool as well as provides instructions on how to download this tool. This tool has not been updated to support the Windows Journal Viewer security update.</p>
<p><strong>What does the GDI+ Detection tool do?</strong></p>
<p>The GDI+ Detection tool scans your system for non-operating system software listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components sections of this security bulletin that are known to contain the vulnerable component. It then directs consumers to the appropriate locations for downloading an update to address the vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Will the GDI+ Detection tool tell me if my system is at risk from this vulnerability?</strong></p>
<p>No. The tool is only designed to scan the system and detect for the software listed in the Affected Software and Affected Components sections of this security bulletin that are known to contain the vulnerable component. The tool is not able to determine if these products have already been updated to use a secure version of the affected component.</p>
<p><strong>I use Software Update Services (SUS) to deploy security updates in my enterprise. Should I deploy the GDI+ Detection Tool to all of my systems?</strong></p>
<p>The GDI+ Detection Tool was available via SUS but has been removed. This tool is not designed for use or supported in enterprise environments.</p>
<p><strong>What security updates will Windows Update offer to help address this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130" data-linktype="external">Windows Update</a> will offer the required operating system updates for Windows XP, Windows XP Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003. Windows XP Service Pack 2 does not require an update because it does not contain a vulnerable version of the affected component. Windows Update will offer the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 security update to Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 operating systems. Windows Update will offer the .NET Framework, version 1.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) and the .NET Framework, version 1.1 Service Pack 1 to Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 operating systems. Windows Update will offer an update for the Windows Journal Viewer only to Windows 2000-based systems that have installed the Windows Journal Viewer. These security updates are not offered to Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 systems because these operating system components and applications use the operating system version of the affected component on Window XP and Windows Server 2003.</p>
<p>Also, as explained in a previous FAQ, there are cases, when using Windows XP Service Pack 2, where the original versions of the Office XP, Visio 2002, and Project 2002 security updates may not have installed correctly. For these Windows XP Service Pack 2 customers, Microsoft has provided an updated installation package through Windows Update that will correct the installation problem and install the correct files. Since Windows XP Service Pack 2 recommends and prompts customers to turn Automatic Update on, most Windows XP Service Pack 2 users will not have to take any additional steps. This updated installation package is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;885884" data-linktype="external">885884</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary" data-linktype="external">buffer overrun</a> vulnerability exists in the processing of JPEG image formats that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. Any program that processes JPEG images on the affected systems could be vulnerable to this attack, and any system that uses the affected programs or components could be vulnerable to this attack. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-jpeg-vulnerability---can-2004-0200">Mitigating factors for JPEG Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0200:</h4>
<ul>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</li>
<li>The vulnerability could only be exploited by an attacker who persuaded a user to open a specially crafted file or to view a directory that contains the specially crafted image. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a malicious file.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.</li>
<li>Windows XP, Window XP Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 are the only operating systems that contain the vulnerable component by default. By default, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, and Windows XP Service Pack 2 are not vulnerable to this issue. However, the vulnerable component will be installed by any of the programs listed in the affected software section of this bulletin on these operating systems and you should install the appropriate security update for those programs.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-jpeg-vulnerability---can-2004-0200">Workarounds for JPEG Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0200:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.</p>
<p><strong>Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.</p>
<p>Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;307594" data-linktype="external">307594</a>.</p>
<p>For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=291387" data-linktype="external">291387</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.</li>
<li>Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost. <strong>Note</strong> Manually viewing these pictures could allow remote code execution if you are using a vulnerable application or operating system.</li>
<li>Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="faq-for-jpeg-vulnerability---can-2004-0200">FAQ for JPEG Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0200:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21141" data-linktype="external">buffer overrun</a> vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrator privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An unchecked buffer in the processing of JPEG images.</p>
<p><strong>What are JPEG images?</strong><br/>
JPEG is a platform-independent image format that supports a high level of compression. JPEG is a widely supported Internet standard developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts that have full privileges.</p>

<p><strong>Verifying Update Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Search Results pane</strong>, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>All or part of the file name box</strong>, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{0BD1F5EF-CC01-482D-8132-BB680DB892A3}</p>

<p><strong>Software Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy this security update with Software Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133" data-linktype="external">Software Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Management Server:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/evaluation/capabilities/patch.mspx" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/suspack/" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sms/sms2003/patchupdate.mspx" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sms/2003/downloads/featurepacks/adminpack.mspx" data-linktype="external"><strong>SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack</strong></a> and in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/smserver/downloads/20/featurepacks/adminpack/" data-linktype="external"><strong>SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack</strong></a>) to install these updates.</p>
