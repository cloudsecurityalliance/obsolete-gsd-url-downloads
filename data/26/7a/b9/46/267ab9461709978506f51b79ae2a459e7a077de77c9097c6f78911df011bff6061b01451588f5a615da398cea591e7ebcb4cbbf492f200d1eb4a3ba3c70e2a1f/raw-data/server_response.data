<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-active-template-library-atl-could-allow-remote-code-execution-973908">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) Could Allow Remote Code Execution (973908)</h2>
<p>Published: August 11, 2009 | Updated: December 16, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL). The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user loaded a specially crafted component or control hosted on a malicious website. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information on the software affected by this update, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section. For more information on the impact of, and workarounds and mitigations for controls and components that may be vulnerable to these issues, please see <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)</a>.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the ATL headers so that components and controls built using the headers can safely initialize from a data stream, and by providing updated versions of Windows components and controls built using corrected ATL headers. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong>  The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973908" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 973908</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why was this bulletin rereleased on September 8, 2009?</strong><br/>
Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to offer new updates for the HtmlInput Object ActiveX control on Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, Windows Vista, Windows Vista Service Pack 1, Windows Vista Service Pack 2, Windows Vista x64 Edition, Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 1, and Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2.</p>
<p><strong>What is the HtmlInput Object ActiveX control?</strong><br/>
The HtmlInput Object ActiveX control enables Windows Media Center hosted HTML applications to include instances of the Triple-tap/Soft-keyboard ActiveX control on their HTML pages. The control provides a standard interface for retrieving text input from the user, enabling them to enter text by using the remote control. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms814716.aspx" data-linktype="external">HtmlInput Object</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
Refer to the reference tables in the <strong>Security Update Deployment</strong> section for the location of the file information details.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>How does this bulletin relate to the vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)?</strong>
This bulletin addresses Windows components that are affected by the Active Template Library (ATL) vulnerabilities described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Is this security update related to MS09-034, released as an out-of-band update on July 28, 2009?</strong><br/>
Yes. Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199" data-linktype="external">MS09-034</a>, &quot;Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer,&quot; includes a mitigation that helps prevent components and controls built using the vulnerable ATL from being exploited in Internet Explorer, as well as addressing multiple unrelated vulnerabilities. The new defense in depth protections offered in MS09-034 include updates to Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6 and Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8, that monitor and help prevent the successful exploitation of all known public and private ATL vulnerabilities, including the vulnerabilities that could lead to bypassing ActiveX's Kill Bit Security Feature. These protections are designed to help protect customers from Web-based attacks.</p>
<p><strong>If I have installed the MS09-034 update, do I still need to install this update?</strong><br/>
Yes. This security bulletin update addresses vulnerabilities in Windows components. By installing this update, users ensure that all known issues caused by vulnerable ATL headers and libraries are corrected for core Windows components.</p>
<p><strong>If I have installed the MS09-034 update, do I still need to install additional components and controls issued by third-parties that address the vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory 973882 and Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-035?</strong>
Yes, you need to install updated controls from third parties when released. The <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=158199" data-linktype="external">MS09-034</a> Internet Explorer mitigation does not address the underlying vulnerabilities within certain components and controls developed with the Active Template Library. Microsoft recommends that developers follow the guidance provided in this bulletin to modify and rebuild all components and controls affected by vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>What is ATL?</strong>
The Active Template Library (ATL) is a set of template-based C++ classes that let developers create small, fast Component Object Model (COM) objects. It has special support for key COM features, including stock implementations, dual interfaces, standard COM enumerator interfaces, connection points, tear-off interfaces, and ActiveX controls. For more information, see the following <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3ax346b7(vs.71).aspx" data-linktype="external">MSDN article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX Control?</strong>
The DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control provides an HTML editor that developers can use to support dynamic Web site HTML editing in software. For more information about the DHTML Editing Component ActiveX control, see the following <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa753630(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">MSDN article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Microsoft MSWebDVD ActiveX Control?</strong>
The Microsoft MSWebDVD ActiveX control is used to create script-based DVD applications by exposing the MSWebDVD object to applications. For more information, see the following <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd390904(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">MSDN article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is Outlook Express?</strong>
Outlook Express is a feature of the Windows operating system for personal computers. It is used for sending and receiving e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>What is Windows Media Player?</strong>
Windows Media Player is a feature of the Windows operating system for personal computers. It is used for playing audio and video.</p>
<p><strong>Are third-party components and controls affected by this issue?</strong>
Some third-party components and controls may be affected by this issue if certain conditions were met during the building of the components and controls. Microsoft recommends that developers follow the guidance provided in this bulletin to modify and rebuild all components and controls affected by vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>

Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015  
-------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to the function CComVariant::ReadFromStream used in the ATL header. This function does not properly restrict untrusted data read from a stream. This issue leads to reading data directly onto the stack instead of reading it into the area of memory allocated for an array, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0015](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-0015).

#### FAQ for Microsoft Video ActiveX Control Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0015
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer, instantiating a vulnerable component or control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
  
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The function CComVariant::ReadFromStream used in the ATL header does not properly restrict untrusted data read from a stream. This issue could lead to reading data directly onto the stack instead of reading it into the area of memory allocated for an array.
  
**Is this security update related to MS09-032?**   
Yes. Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS09-032](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=157386), "Cumulative Security Update of ActiveX Kill Bits," includes ActiveX kill bits for msvidctl.dll as a part of CVE-2008-0015. This bulletin, MS09-037, also addresses components affected by CVE-2008-0015. In MS09-032, kill bits were provided for msvidctl.dll, since that component was never intended to be instantiated within Internet Explorer. The components addressed in this bulletin may be instantiated, and have been updated to address the core issue covered by CVE-2008-0015.
  
**If I have installed the MS09-032 update, do I still need to install this update?**   
Yes. This security update addresses vulnerabilities in Windows components. By installing this update, users ensure that all known issues caused by vulnerable ATL headers and libraries are corrected for core Windows components.
  
**Are third-party ActiveX controls affected by this issue?**  
Although this vulnerability is in Microsoft ATL, it is not in the ATL version shipped with Visual Studio. The affected ATL headers reside in a private header file that shipped in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Most third-party developers use the header file that came with Visual Studio. These applications are not exposed to this vulnerability.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
If a user has a vulnerable control on their system and an attacker bypasses the mitigations described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882), then an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer by attempting to exploit a vulnerable control, and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have to discover a vulnerable control, and force users to visit these Web sites. To do this, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the affecting Window components and controls to restrict data read from untrusted streams to ensure it is not copied directly to the memory stack.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.
  
ATL Header Memcopy Vulnerability - CVE-2008-0020  
------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to an error in the Load method of the IPersistStreamInit interface. The Load method could allow calls to memcopy with untrusted data, which could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-0020](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-0020).

ATL Object Type Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2494  
------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to a bug in the ATL header that could allow reading a variant from a stream and leaving the variant type read with an invalid variant. When deleting the variant, it is possible to free unintended areas in memory that could be controlled by an attacker.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-2494](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-2494).

#### FAQ for ATL Object Type Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2494
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer, instantiating a vulnerable component or control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.
  
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability is caused by a bug in the ATL header that could allow reading a variant from a stream and leaving the variant type read with an invalid variant. When deleting the variant, it would be possible to free unintended areas in memory that could be controlled by an attacker, resulting in inconsistent memory contents and execution of malicious code.
  
**Are third-party ActiveX controls affected by this issue?**  
Although this vulnerability is in Microsoft ATL, it is not in the ATL version shipped with Visual Studio. The affected ATL headers reside in a private header file that shipped in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Most third-party developers use the header file that came with Visual Studio. These applications are not exposed to this issue.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
If a user has a vulnerable control on their system, and an attacker bypasses the mitigations described in [Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)](http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882), then if the user is logged on with administrative user rights an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer by attempting to exploit a vulnerable control, and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have to discover a vulnerable control, and force users to visit these Web sites. To do this, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update addresses the issue by properly validating variants read from a stream and providing updated versions of Windows components and controls built using corrected ATL headers.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**
  
Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang=en).
  
The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
</li>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch            | Description                                                                                                                                |  
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches.                                                                                                       |  
| **/quiet**        | Suppresses the display of status or error messages.                                                                                        |  
| **/norestart**    | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |
  
**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**    
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**    
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
