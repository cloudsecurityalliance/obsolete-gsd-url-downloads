<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities in Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG). The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user visits an affected Web site using a specially crafted URL. However, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for all supported versions of Forefront Unified Access Gateway 2010. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that UAG handles input and redirect verification. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.</p>

UAG Redirection Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2732  
------------------------------------------------------
  
A spoofing vulnerability exists in Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG). The vulnerability could allow spoofing or redirecting of traffic intended for the UAG server if a UAG user clicks a specially crafted link. An attacker could send a specially crafted URL to a user of the UAG server to redirect Web traffic to a malicious site with content similar to the original Web site. By doing so, the attacker could potentially acquire sensitive information, such as the user's credentials.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-2732](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-2732).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for UAG Redirection Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2732
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
  
#### Workarounds for UAG Redirection Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2732
  
Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

UAG XSS Allows EOP Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2733  
------------------------------------------------
  
A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Forefront Unified Access Gateway (UAG) that could allow specially crafted script code to run under the guise of the server. This is a non-persistent cross-site scripting vulnerability that could allow an attacker to issue commands to the UAG server in the context of the targeted user.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-2733](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-2733).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for UAG XSS Allows EOP Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2733
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
  
#### Workarounds for UAG XSS Allows EOP Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2733
  
Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.
  
#### FAQ for UAG XSS Allows EOP Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2733
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a non-persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause script code to run in the guise of a third-party Web site. Such script code would run inside the browser when visiting the third-party Web site, and could take any action on the user's computer that the third-party Web site was permitted to take. The vulnerability could only be exploited if the user clicked on a hypertext link, either in an HTML e-mail or if the user visited an attacker's Web site or a Web site containing content that is under the attacker's control.
  
**What is cross-site scripting?**   
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow specially crafted script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of "trusted" sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, specially crafted script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.
  
**How does cross-site scripting work?**   
Web pages contain text and HTML markup. Text and HTML markup are generated by the server and are interpreted by the client. If untrusted content is introduced into a dynamic page, neither the server nor the client has sufficient information to recognize that such injection has occurred and to take protective measures.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
This vulnerability results from improper input validation of the HTTP stream.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject a client-side script in the user's browser. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site on behalf of the targeted user.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by having a user visit the affected Web site using a specially crafted URL. This can be done by way of any medium that can contain URL Web links controlled by the attacker, such as a link in an e-mail, on a Web site, or a redirect on a Web site. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the affected Web site using a specially crafted URL, or to the attacker's Web site.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
UAG servers with users who are authorized to access UAG Web Monitor are primarily at risk.
  
**What does the update do?**   
This update modifies the way that the UAG Web Monitor accepts input.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
</li>
</ul>
