IV. SOLUTIONS

    A. APARS

        IBM has assigned the following APARs to this problem:

        AIX Level     APAR number      Availability    SP        KEY
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        7.1.1         IV51420          08/29/2014      SP10      key_w_apar
        7.1.2         IV51421          08/29/2014      SP5       key_w_apar

        Subscribe to the APARs here:

        http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IV51420
        http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IV51421

        By subscribing, you will receive periodic email alerting you
        to the status of the APAR, and a link to download the fix once
        it becomes available.

    B. FIXES

        Fixes are available.  The fixes can be downloaded via ftp
        from:

        ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/wparcre_fix.tar

        The link above is to a tar file containing this signed
        advisory, fix packages, and PGP signatures for each package.
        The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will
        enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX
        Technology Levels.

        AIX Level                     Interim Fix (*.Z)             KEY
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        7.1.1.8    Wpar 5.2           IV51420s52.131030.epkg.Z      key_w_fix
        7.1.1.8    Wpar 5.3           IV51420s53.131031.epkg.Z      key_w_fix
        7.1.2.3    Wpar 5.2           IV51421s52.131030.epkg.Z      key_w_fix
        7.1.2.3    Wpar 5.3           IV51421s53.131031.epkg.Z      key_w_fix

        The epkg's named with an "s52" must be applied inside a 5.2 WPAR,
        and those with the "s53" must be applied inside a 5.3 WPAR. The 
        WPAR(s) can be either rootvg WPAR or non-rootvg; either is fine.

        To extract the fixes from the tar file:

        tar xvf wparcre_fix.tar
        cd wparcre_fix

        Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

        The checksums below were generated using the
        "csum -h SHA1" (sha1sum) command is the followng:

        csum -h SHA1 (sha1sum)                    filename
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
        a175a14ca5756b80649bd864d392eeddc1fc6451  IV51420s52.131030.epkg.Z
        fc1dac514e75cbe72ba571143f82ddfd6d2ad551  IV51420s53.131031.epkg.Z
        6550a8e30162348ab725b4750d979d3f9f5a9a85  IV51421s52.131030.epkg.Z
        301b071f5d95acb5b365bb91822619cbe7465bbf  IV51421s53.131031.epkg.Z

        To verify the sum, use the text of this advisory as input to sha1sum.
        For example:

        csum -h SHA1 -i wparcre_advisory.asc
        sha1sum -c wparcre_advisory.asc

        These sums should match exactly. The PGP signatures in the tar
        file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the
        integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be
        confirmed, contact IBM AIX Security at
        security-alert@austin.ibm.com and describe the discrepancy.

V. WORKAROUNDS

     Do not run ftpd in a 5.2 or 5.3 WPAR.
