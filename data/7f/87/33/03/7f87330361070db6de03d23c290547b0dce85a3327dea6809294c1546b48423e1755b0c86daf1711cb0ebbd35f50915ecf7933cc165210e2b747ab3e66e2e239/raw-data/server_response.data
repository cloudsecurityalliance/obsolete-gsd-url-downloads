                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION

    A vulnerability exists in the inventory scout code which may allow a user
    to delete vital system files and allow an attacker to cause the software 
    to operate on unauthorized files.

II. CVSS
    
    CVSS Base Score: 6.3
    CVSS Temporal Score: See http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/71615 for the
    current score
    CVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined

III. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

    # lslpp -l | grep invscout.rte

    The following filesets are vulnerable:

    AIX 7.1, 6.1, 5.3: all versions less than 2.2.0.19

    NOTE: The invscout.rte is based on an independent service release and is
    not tied to any particular version or release of AIX.

IV. SOLUTIONS

    A. APARS

        IBM has assigned the following APARs to this problem:

        AIX Level           APAR number        Availability
        ---------------------------------------------------
        5.3                 IV11643            available
        6.1                 IV11643            available
        7.1                 IV11643            available

        Subscribe to the APARs here:

        http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IV11643

        By subscribing, you will receive periodic email alerting you
        to the status of the APAR, and a link to download the fix once
        it becomes available.

     B. FIX

        IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
        of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
        readable before proceeding.

        To preview a fix installation:

        installp -a -d fix_name -p all  # where fix_name is the name of the
                                        # fix package being previewed.
        To install a fix package:

        installp -a -d fix_name -X all  # where fix_name is the name of the  
                                        # fix package being installed.

        Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression
        testing but not the full regression testing that takes place
        for Service Packs; thus, IBM does not warrant the fully
        correct functionality of an interim fix.

V. WORKAROUNDS

    a) Remove the setuid bit from the following:

        chmod 555 /opt/IBMinvscout/bin/invscoutClient_VPD_Survey
        chmod 555 /opt/IBMinvscout/sbin/invscout_lsvpd

	NOTE: chmod will disable functionality of these commands for
        all users except root.
