        B. FIXES

            Fixes are available. A system reboot is recommended after
            installing the iFixes.

            The fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:

            ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/bellmail_fix.tar
            http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/bellmail_fix.tar
            https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/bellmail_fix.tar 

            The links above are to a tar file containing this signed
            advisory, fix packages, and OpenSSL signatures for each package.

            The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will
            enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX
            Technology Levels.

            AIX Level  Interim Fix (*.Z)         KEY
            ----------------------------------------------

            VIOS Level  Interim Fix (*.Z)         KEY
            -----------------------------------------------
            2.2.3.x    IV91006s8a.161125.epkg.Z  key_w_fix
            2.2.4.x    IV91006s8a.161125.epkg.Z  key_w_fix
            2.2.5.x    IV91006s8a.161125.epkg.Z  key_w_fix


            Please note that the above table refers to AIX TL/SP level as
            opposed to fileset level, i.e., 7.1.4.1 is AIX 7100-04-01.

            To extract the fixes from the tar file:

            tar xvf bellmail_fix.tar
            cd bellmail_fix

            Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

            The checksums below were generated using the
            "openssl dgst -sha256 <filename>‚Äù command as the following:

            openssl dgst -sha256                                              filename                 KEY

            These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar
            file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the
            integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be
            confirmed, contact IBM AIX Security at
            security-alert@austin.ibm.com and describe the discrepancy.

        C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION

            IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
            of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
            readable before proceeding.

            To preview a fix installation:

            installp -a -d fix_name -p all  # where fix_name is the name of the
                                            # fix package being previewed.
            To install a fix package:

            installp -a -d fix_name -X all  # where fix_name is the name of the
                                            # fix package being installed.

            Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression
            testing but not the full regression testing that takes place
            for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

            Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

            http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html
            https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html

            To preview an interim fix installation:

            emgr -e epkg_name -p         # where epkg_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being previewed.

            To install an interim fix package:

            emgr -e epkg_name -X         # where epkg_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being installed.

    WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS:

        None.
