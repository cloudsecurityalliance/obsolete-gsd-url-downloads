<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-sharepoint-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-2451858">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2451858)</h2>
<p>Published: September 13, 2011 | Updated: October 11, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.3</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint and Windows SharePoint Services. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicked on a specially crafted URL or visited a specially crafted Web site. For the most severe vulnerabilities, Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 helps to block the attacks in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Office Groove 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010, Microsoft Office Forms Server 2007, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft Office Groove Data Bridge Server 2007, Microsoft Office Groove Management Server 2007, Microsoft Groove Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Services 2.0, Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010, and Microsoft Word Web App 2010. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input, parses malicious XML and XSL files, and handles script contained inside of specific request parameters. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>. For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating" data-linktype="external">Understanding Windows automatic updating</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2451858" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2451858</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update  
----------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Why was this bulletin revised on October 11, 2011?**  
Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce the following changes to detection logic:
  
-   To address an installation issue, changed detection logic so that the update for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 Service Pack 1 (pplwfe) (KB2560890) will no longer be offered to customers running Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 on systems configured as part of a multiple-system SharePoint server farm. Instead, the update must be applied manually to servers in a Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 farm. For more information about installing an update on a Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 farm, see the TechNet article, [Install a software update (SharePoint Server 2010)](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff806338.aspx). This is a change to detection logic only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010 who have successfully applied the KB2560890 update do not need to take any further action.  
-   To address an offering issue, corrected detection logic so that the update for Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 and Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 Service Pack 1 (KB2494001) properly replaces previous update packages. This is a change to detection logic only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers of Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 who have successfully applied the KB2494001 update do not need to take any further action.
  
**Where are the file information details?**  
Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.
  
**How is this security update related to MS11-050?**  
The HTML Sanitization Vulnerability (CVE-2011-1252) is addressed by this update (MS11-074) and the [Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=217212) (MS11-050) update.
  
Two different updates are needed because the modifications that are required to address the issue are located in different Microsoft products. This update (MS11-074) addresses the vulnerability in affected Microsoft productivity software and MS11-050 addresses the vulnerability in Internet Explorer.
  
**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**  
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files.
  
**Why are multiple server-package updates available for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?**  
The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different server-package updates as indicated in the **Affected Software** table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2007. Coreserverx, oserver, sserverx, and dlc are the internal names of the SharePoint components in this servicing model.
  
**Why** **are** **multiple server-package updates listed for Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010?**  
The updates required to address the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin are offered across different server-package updates as indicated in the **Affected Software** table due to the componentized servicing model for Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010. Mosrchwfe, osrv, pplwfe, ppsmawfe, dlc, ppsmamui, and wosrv are the internal names of the SharePoint components in this servicing model.
  
**I use Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 or Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010. Do I need to install all** **of** **the updates listed in the Affected Software table for the software?**  
Yes. Customers should apply all server-package updates offered for the software installed on their systems.
  
For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, depending on their configuration of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server, not all the server-package updates listed in this bulletin may apply. For more information on the applicability of these server-package updates in a SharePoint environment, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2451858](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2451858).
  
**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**  
No. Multiple updates for one version of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server can be applied in any sequence.
  
**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**  
Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the **Vulnerability Information** section of this bulletin, this update includes a defense-in-depth update to help improve Microsoft SharePoint's handling of cross-application redirects.
  
**What is defense-in-depth?**  
In information security, defense-in-depth refers to an approach in which multiple layers of defense are in place to help prevent attackers from compromising the security of a network or system.
  
**What is Microsoft Groove Server 2010?**  
Microsoft Groove Server 2010 provides comprehensive services for managing Microsoft SharePoint Workspace. Groove Server 2010 contains two components: Groove Server 2010 Manager and Groove Server 2010 Relay, each of which runs on a Windows server on an enterprise network.
  
**What is Microsoft Office Web Apps?**  
[Microsoft Office Web Apps](http://office.microsoft.com/web-apps) is the online companion to Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote applications that enables users, regardless of their location, to access and edit documents. Users can view, share, and work on documents with others across personal computers, mobile phones, and the Web. Office Web Apps is available to business customers with Microsoft Office 2010 volume licensing and document management solutions based on Microsoft SharePoint 2010 products.
  
**Where are updates for Microsoft Office Web Apps applied?**  
Customers who have deployed Microsoft Office Web Apps in a SharePoint environment will need to apply the updates for Microsoft Office Web Apps on the servers on which those components are installed. For more information about deploying Microsoft Office Web Apps, see the Microsoft TechNet article, [Understanding Office Web Apps](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff431685.aspx).
  
**Note** The update for Microsoft Office Web Apps does not apply to the client workstations that use a Web browser to access Microsoft Office Web Apps.
  
**What is Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010?**  
[Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010](http://technet.microsoft.com/sharepoint/ee263910.aspx) is the new version of Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services. It is the essential solution for organizations that need a secure, manageable, Web-based collaboration platform. SharePoint helps teams stay connected and productive by providing easy access to the people, documents, and information that they need to make well-informed decisions and get work done. Use SharePoint Foundation to coordinate schedules, organize documents, and participate in discussions through team workspaces, blogs, wikis, and document libraries on the platform that is the underlying infrastructure for SharePoint Server.
  
**What is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0?**  
[Windows SharePoint Services 3.0](http://technet.microsoft.com/windowsserver/sharepoint/bb684453) provides a platform for collaborative applications, offering a common framework for document management and a common repository for storing documents of all types. It exposes key Windows Server services like Windows Workflow Services and Windows Rights Management Services.
  
Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 is provided as a free download for supported editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008.
  
**How is Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 related to Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007?**  
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 is an integrated suite of server capabilities built on top of Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.
  
For systems with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 installed, you will need to apply the KB2493987 update for Windows SharePoint Services 3.0. There is no configuration where you can only have Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 and not Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services 3.0.
  
**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**  
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.
  
It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).
  
Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

<h2 id="xss-in-sharepoint-calendar-vulnerability---cve-2011-0653">XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653</h2>
<p>A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint 2010 that could result in information disclosure or elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript elements. Due to the vulnerability, when the malicious JavaScript is echoed back to the user's browser, the resulting page could allow an attacker to issue SharePoint commands in the context of the authenticated user on the targeted SharePoint site.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-0653" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-0653</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-xss-in-sharepoint-calendar-vulnerability---cve-2011-0653">Mitigating Factors for XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site and then convince them to click a specially crafted URL that is used to exploit the vulnerability.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.</li>
<li>An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run when the user clicks a specially crafted URL, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a specially crafted URL that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-xss-in-sharepoint-calendar-vulnerability---cve-2011-0653">Workarounds for XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653</h4>

<h4 id="faq-for-xss-in-sharepoint-calendar-vulnerability---cve-2011-0653">FAQ for XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft SharePoint does not properly handle malicious JavaScript elements contained within a specially crafted URL, allowing the script to be displayed back to the user's browser.</p>
<p><strong>What is cross-site scripting?</strong><br/>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site that then displays the script back to the user's browser.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted SharePoint site and by convincing the user to click on the specially crafted URL.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted SharePoint site that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to click on the specially crafted URL.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where users connect to a SharePoint server, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9</strong> <strong>Cross-site Scripting</strong> <strong>(XSS) Filter?</strong><br/>
Cross-site scripting attacks try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Web sites you use. In the case of this vulnerability, you might receive an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted Web site address that includes JavaScript elements. When you click on the URL, you are directed to a legitimate SharePoint site where the attacker-provided script is run. Cross-site scripting attacks have emerged as a leading online threat, so Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 include a cross-site scripting filter that can detect these types of attacks and disable the harmful scripts. By default, the cross-site scripting filter is turned on in Internet Explorer 8 for the Internet Zone.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="html-sanitization-vulnerability---cve-2011-1252">HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252</h2>
<p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a site that is filtering HTML content via SafeHTML.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused by the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML.</p>
<p><strong>What is cross-site scripting?</strong><br/>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages.

Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks against users of a targeted site that uses SafeHTML to sanitize HTML. An attacker could then potentially run script on behalf of a victim user on the site.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target site using SafeHTML. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations the specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content.</p>
<p>For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted specially crafted script to the targeted site using SafeHTML, any Web page on that site that contains the specially crafted script is a potential vector for persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a Web page that contains the specially crafted script, the script could be run in the security context of the user.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where users connect to a server that uses SafeHTML to sanitize HTML content, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that SafeHTML sanitizes HTML content.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-1252" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-1252</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<h2 id="sharepoint-xss-vulnerability---cve-2011-1893">SharePoint XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1893</h2>
<p>A cross-site scripting, information disclosure, and elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint Server and Windows SharePoint Services where JavaScript that is encoded in a specially crafted URL can be reflected back to the user in the resulting page, allowing an attacker to issue SharePoint commands in the context of the authenticated user on a targeted SharePoint site.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-1893" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-1893</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-sharepoint-xss-vulnerability---cve-2011-1893">Mitigating Factors for SharePoint XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1893</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS Filter, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.</li>
<li>An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run by the user who visiting a specially crafted Web site, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click on a link to a specially crafted Web site that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-sharepoint-xss-vulnerability---cve-2011-1893">Workarounds for SharePoint XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1893</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Enable Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to enable the XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone (XSS filter is enabled by default in the Internet security zone). To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer 8 or Internet Explorer 9, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Enable XSS filter</strong>, click <strong>Enable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> Internal sites not previously flagged as being XSS risks could be flagged.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong> </p>
<p>To undo this workaround, perform the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer 8 or Internet Explorer 9, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>

<h4 id="faq-for-sharepoint-xss-vulnerability---cve-2011-1893">FAQ for SharePoint XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1893</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability which could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability is caused by input sanitation which will allow for a malicious URL that contains JavaScript elements to be displayed back to the user.</p>
<p><strong>What is cross-site scripting?</strong><br/>
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could reflect malicious JavaScript back to the browser of the user, which could allow the attacker to modify the page content, conduct phishing, and perform actions on behalf of the user.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted SharePoint site and by convincing the user to click on the specially crafted URL.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted SharePoint site that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to click on the specially crafted URL.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Client systems that use Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services or connect to a Microsoft SharePoint Server, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input to block the reflective XSS attack vector.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>You can also click the <strong>Details</strong> tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
<li>Finally, you can also click the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.</li>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as hotfix, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)
