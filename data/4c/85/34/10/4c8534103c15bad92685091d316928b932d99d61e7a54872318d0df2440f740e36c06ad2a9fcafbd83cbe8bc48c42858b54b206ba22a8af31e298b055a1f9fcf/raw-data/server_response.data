<b>A  Bunch  of  Broken  Schemes:  A  Simple  yet  Powerful  Linear  Approach  to  Analyzing  Security  of  Attribute-Based  Encryption</b><p />
<i>Marloes  Venema   and  Greg  Alpár</i><p />
<b>Abstract: </b>Verifying  security  of  advanced  cryptographic  primitives  such  as  attribute-based  encryption (ABE)  is  often  difficult.  In  this  work,  we  show  how  to  break  eleven  schemes:  two  single-authority   and  nine  multi-authority (MA)  ABE  schemes.  Notably,  we  break  DAC-MACS,  a  highly-cited  multi-authority  scheme,  published  at  TIFS.  This  suggests  that,  indeed,  verifying  security  of  complex  schemes  is  complicated,   and  may  require  simpler  tools.  The  multi-authority  attacks  also  illustrate  that  mistakes  are  made  in  transforming  single-authority  schemes  into  multi-authority  ones.  To  simplify  verifying  security,  we  systematize  our  methods  to  a  linear  approach  to  analyzing  generic  security  of  ABE.  Our  approach  is  not  only  useful  in  analyzing  existing  schemes,  but  can  also  be  applied  during  the  design   and  reviewing  of  new  schemes.  As  such,  it  can  prevent  the  employment  of  insecure (MA-)ABE  schemes  in  the  future.
