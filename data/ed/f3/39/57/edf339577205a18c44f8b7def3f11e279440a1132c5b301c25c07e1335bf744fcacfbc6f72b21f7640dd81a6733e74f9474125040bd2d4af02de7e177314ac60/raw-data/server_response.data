                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION 

    A nameserver with DNSSEC validation enabled may  incorrectly add
    records to its cache from the additional section of responses 
    received during resolution of a recursive client query. This 
    behavior only occurs when processing client queries with checking
    disabled (CD) at the same time as requesting DNSSEC records (DO).

    Please see the following for more information:
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-4022
    http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/418861

II. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

    Note: To use the following commands on VIOS you must first
    execute:

    oem_setup_env

    To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following
    command:

    lslpp -L bos.net.tcp.client bos.net.tcp.server

    The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

    AIX Fileset        Lower Level       Upper Level
    ------------------------------------------------
    bos.net.tcp.client	  6.1.2.0	 6.1.2.6
    bos.net.tcp.server	  6.1.2.0	 6.1.2.4
    bos.net.tcp.client	  6.1.3.0	 6.1.3.3
    bos.net.tcp.server	  6.1.3.0	 6.1.3.2
    bos.net.tcp.client	  6.1.4.0	 6.1.4.2
    bos.net.tcp.server	  6.1.4.0	 6.1.4.1

III. SOLUTION

    A. FIXES

	APARS are available for all supported releases.
