            <p>We're about to get another CVE to our name.</p>
<p>Let's talk a bit on how we found it. One of our customers commissioned a
test of their infrastructure. On of their systems was running the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.crashplan.com/en-us/">Crashplan</a> backup server from Code42,
and we found a remote code execution possibility. As luck would have it
(for our customer that is) a setting in their firewalls made it
impossible to exploit it in their environment, but naturally we reported
it to Code42. Their response was... well, not what we hoped...</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a short write-up of how we found it (and we usually
shorthand Radically Open Security into 'ROS' when doing these writeups,
so I'll continue that). And when I say &quot;we&quot; I really mean &quot;Erik Bosman&quot;
since he's the pentester who did all the work on this one, and he
deserves all the credit here.</p>
<p>During a port scan on crashplan.REDACTED.com, ROS found an open port
with a service communicating using an unknown binary protocol. The
service on TCP port 4282 seemed to be sending Java class names over the
wire.</p>

<p>Finding class names in a messaging protocol can be indicative of the use
of (de)serialization. (De)serialization is the process of translating an
object (or a group of objects) in memory to a stream of bytes and back.
These objects can then be sent over network or stored on disk.
Deserializing arbitrary objects from untrusted data is tricky and can
often lead to remote code execution. The main problem is that allowing
an untrusted party to create arbitrary objects on a system exposes a lot
of normally unreachable code, greatly increasing the attack surface. As
an example, the standard way of deserializing objects in Java, using
ObjectInputStream can be exploited to gain code execution using publicly
available code (Ysoserial: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial">https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial</a>)</p>
<p>The software running on the host in question turned out to be the code42
backup server. Unfortunately, we failed to obtain a test license from
code42, so the source code (for versions 5.3.4 and 5.4.0) was obtained
using a <a class="reference external" href="http://download2.code42.com/installs/proserver/5.4.0/Code42server_5.4.0_Linux.tgz">download
url</a>
from a presentation on Youtube&nbsp; and decompiled using
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/">CFR</a>. This, however meant that we
could not truly test the system locally (and reverse engineering the
licence enforcement was way beyond the scope of the pentest.)</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed that code42 uses a number of different ways to
serialize and deserialize objects. Objects implementing the IMessage
interface, sent over port 4282 are deserialized using one of two
methods:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Legacy Messages</dt>
<dd>A home-brew deserialization method for data objects implementing the
IMessage interface</dd>
<dt>Google Protocol Buffers</dt>
<dd>A newer method, also employed to (de)serialize IMessage objects.
It is up to the sender to decide which method is used.</dd>
</dl>
<p>However, some of these messages have custom deserialization
implementations or they contain references to other objects which are
not IMessages themselves. ROS found a number of (de)serialization
implementations being used:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>com.code42.io.TinySerializer</dt>
<dd>recursively deserializes objects with only primitive types. ROS did
not find a way to exploit this deserializer.</dd>
<dt>com.code42.io.C42WhitelistObjectInputStream</dt>
<dd>A subclass of the vulnerable java.io.ObjectInputStream, however,
this class overloads the resolveClass method to only allow
deserialization of a select subset of objects, thwarting exploits
generated using Ysoserial.</dd>
<dt>com.code42.io.CompressUtilityWhitelist</dt>
<dd>A decompression wrapper around C42WhitelistObjectInputStream</dd>
<dt>java.io.ObjectInputStream</dt>
<dd>Some code is still using the directly vulnerable
java.io.ObjectInputStream, however, this code did not seem related
to network communication and we did not find a way to
ObjectInputStream directly on our own data.</dd>
</dl>
<p>While com.code42.io.C42WhitelistObjectInputStream limits the types of
objects that can be loaded, it is not immediately clear that it can
prevent exploitation alltogether.</p>
<p>First, while it is not possible to create instances of classes outside
of the whitelist, due to a loophole, by creating a 'Proxy' class, which
partially bypasses the overloaded resolveClass method, it is still
possible to load <em>any</em> class, even non-serializable classes, but not to
create an instance of it. The act of loading a class alone can result in
the execution of code defined in <tt class="docutils literal">static { ... }</tt> sections of classes.
We created a program which tried to load all classes in the classpath
used by Crashplan. This did yield some interesting results, such as
(non-functional) Java GUI windows popping up, and a logger being
started. But it did not give us any results which would allow us to
exploit the program.</p>
<p>More importantly, the number of classes still allowed is quite large,
the whitelist allows objects which match any of the following rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Object is an array</li>
<li>Object is serialiable and part of the <tt class="docutils literal">com.code42</tt> package or any
of its sub-packages</li>
<li>Object is serialiable and part of the <tt class="docutils literal">com.backup42</tt> package or any
of its sub-packages</li>
<li>Object is serialiable and part of the <tt class="docutils literal">java.lang</tt> package or any of
its sub-packages</li>
<li>Object is serialiable and part of the <tt class="docutils literal">java.util</tt> package or any of
its sub-packages</li>
<li>Object is serialiable and part of the <tt class="docutils literal">com.google.common</tt> package
or any of its sub-packages</li>
<li>Object is serialiable and part of the <tt class="docutils literal">com.google.inject.internal</tt>;
package or any of its sub-packages</li>
<li>Object is of the <tt class="docutils literal">java.io.File</tt> class</li>
<li>Object is of the <tt class="docutils literal">sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo</tt> class</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all publicly available exploit code uses classes outside of this
whitelist, we needed to look for new ways of creating an exploit payload
in this still sizeable list of allowed classes. Given that this would
potentially lead to remote code execution on the backup server, a system
which presumably gets sent sensitive organization data from lots of
different sources, we put a considerable amount of time in trying to
find an exploit payload which would work. In the end, we were unable to
come up with a useful exploit chain. This is not to say that there might
not be one in the future. The whitelist allows for entire subtrees of
packages to be deserialized, new classes may added to packages, for
example when a new version of Java comes out, or when google updates
their java library.</p>
<p>Another avenue that looked interesting, but which we were unable to make
work was using the <tt class="docutils literal">java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda</tt> class. This
class implements the recently added lambda expression support in Java.
What is special about this is that any lambda expression in the codebase
gets serialized as this class and since this class is whitelisted, this
means we may be able to deserialize any lambda expression. However, we
did not find a suitable expression in the codebase to further our goal.</p>
<p>== Pwned in an instance(?) ==</p>
<p>Being unable to find a suitable exploit for the
<tt class="docutils literal">com.code42.io.C42WhitelistObjectInputStream</tt> red herring, we turned
our attention to the custom serialization that is at the heart of the
message parser that is listening on port 4282.</p>
<p>To save network traffic sending class names, new classes are registered
with <tt class="docutils literal">com.code42.messaging.MessageFactory</tt> once, and referred to with
a numeric identifier after. The <tt class="docutils literal">ClassMessage</tt> message, when
deserialized, uses the classloader to load the class specified in the
message, without checking whether this class actually is a valid
message, and it isn't bound by any whitelist like
<tt class="docutils literal">C42WhitelistObjectInputStream</tt>. Then, when the class is loaded, we
can send a message, which is of this class.</p>
<p>com.code42.messaging.MessageFactory will then try to instantiate this
message with the following code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
try {
    message = (IMessage)type.newInstance();
}
catch (Exception e) {
    log.error(&quot;Unable to instantiate new instance! Missing default constructor? - msgUid={}, type={}&quot;, shortUid, type);
}
</pre>
<p>If type does not implement the IMessage interface, this will ofcourse
fail, but not before creating an instance of an arbitrary object with a
default constructor. To investigate if this would be a problem, ROS
tried to instantiate all objects in the classpath (including the jars
that are shipped with crashplan), monitoring network connections, to see
if any of them resulted in useful behaviour. In an overnight run of this
test, we found that <tt class="docutils literal">org.apache.commons.ssl.rmi.DateRMI</tt> creates a
listener socket (on an arbitrary TCP port) upon instantiation. Some
further research yields that this listener socket in fact is a Java
Remote Method Invocation server. This server in turn is vulnerable to
the same deserialization attack we tried to attack before, but without a
whitelist. Testing locally, we were able to gain remote code execution
using a slightly modified version of Ysoserial on the newly created
socket, but due to the unused ports on crashplan.REDACTED.com being
filtered, we were unable to exploit this on the REDACTED infrastructure.</p>
<p>However, we still deemed this to be a security risk. If the firewall is
ever misconfigured or temporarily turned off, or if an attacker can get
behind it, this would lead to arbitrary code execution. It may not be
the easiest one to fix, since it requires some serious rethinking of the
serialization methods used, but that should not be a reason to shift the
responsibility to the customer. Besides, the whitelist is so wide
(perhaps call it a widelist instead?) that it's an accident waiting to
happen.</p>
