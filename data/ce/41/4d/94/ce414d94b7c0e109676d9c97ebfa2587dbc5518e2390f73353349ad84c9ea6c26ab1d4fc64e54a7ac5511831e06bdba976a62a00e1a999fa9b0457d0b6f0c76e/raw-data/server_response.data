<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-office-filters-could-allow-remote-code-execution-924090">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Filters Could Allow Remote Code Execution (924090)</h2>
<p>Published: August 12, 2008 | Updated: August 13, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted image file using Microsoft Office. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Office 2000, and Important for supported editions of Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Project 2002 Service Pack 1, Microsoft Office Converter Pack, and Microsoft Works 8. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office parses the length of a file before passing the file to the allocated buffer. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> None</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why was this bulletin revised on August 13, 2008?</strong><br/>
Microsoft revised this bulletin to clarify that the update for Microsoft Office Project 2002 Service Pack 1 is the same as the update for Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3 in the Affected Software table. Because the update is the same, Project 2002 does not have a separate subsection in the section, <strong>Security Update Deployment</strong>. This is a bulletin change only. Customers who have already successfully installed this update do not have to reinstall.</p>
<p><strong>I do not have all of the affected software installed, but I do have other Microsoft Office applications installed. Why am I being offered the security update?</strong><br/>
The vulnerabilities described in this security update exist within Microsoft Office but could not be exploited using one of the applications listed in the Non-Affected Software table. The Microsoft Office applications listed in the Non-Affected Software table use some of the same files as the applications listed in the Affected Software table to which the security update applies. We recommend installing the update to prevent the security update from being offered again.</p>
<p><strong>I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?</strong><br/>
Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3</a>. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
The file information details can be found in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/924090" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 924090</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>

Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019  
------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that a Microsoft Office filter handles a malformed graphics image. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file that could allow remote code execution if a user opened the file with a Microsoft Office application. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a malicious or compromised Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3019](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-3019).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file containing a specially crafted EPS image that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected Microsoft Office application.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file. Additionally, when Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor in Outlook, a user would need to reply to or forward a malicious e-mail message in order for this vulnerability to be exploited.  
-   Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and Office 2003.
  
#### Workarounds for Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019

#### FAQ for Microsoft Malformed EPS Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3019
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office and could be exploited when a user opens a file containing a malformed graphics image or when a user inserts a malformed graphics image into an Office file. Such a file might also be included in an e-mail attachment. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted EPS file that could allow remote code execution.
  
If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**  
When Microsoft Office opens a specially crafted EPS image file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for Microsoft PICT Filter Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3021
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office and could be exploited when a specially crafted PICT-format image file is opened by any of the affected Microsoft Office applications. Such a file might be included in an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious Web site. Viewing or previewing the specially crafted PICT-format image file in Outlook could not lead to exploitation of this vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability only by constructing a specially crafted image file and convincing a user to open the file with one of the affected applications.
  
If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**  
When Microsoft Office opens a specially crafted PICT image file, it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected Microsoft Office application.
  
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file. Additionally, when Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor in Outlook, a user would need to reply to or forward a malicious e-mail message sent to them in order for this vulnerability to be exploited.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers that have Microsoft Office installed are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
This update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office parses the length of a PICT-format image file before passing the file to the allocated buffer.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office handles a BMP format image file. The vulnerability could be exploited when a Microsoft Office application opens a specially crafted BMP-format image file. Such a specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a malicious or compromised Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-3020](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-3020).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Malformed BMP Filter Vulnerability - CVE-2008-3020
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through a Web-based attack scenario. An attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office file containing a specially crafted BMP image that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince the user to open the file in an affected Microsoft Office application.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who convinced a user to open a specially crafted file. There is no way for an attacker to force a user to open a specially crafted file. Additionally, when Microsoft Word is being used as the HTML e-mail editor in Outlook, a user would need to reply to or forward a malicious e-mail message in order for this vulnerability to be exploited.  
-   Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

**Detection and Deployment Guidance**
  
Microsoft has provided detection and deployment guidance for this month’s security updates. This guidance will also help IT professionals understand how they can use various tools to help deploy the security update, such as Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Office Update, the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the Office Detection Tool, Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), and the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).
  
**Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates as well as common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsahome.mspx).
  
The following table provides the MBSA detection summary for this security update.
  
| Software                             | MBSA 2.1 |  
|--------------------------------------|----------|  
| Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 3 | No       |  
| Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3   | Yes      |  
| Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 | Yes      |  
| Microsoft Office Converter Pack      | Yes      |  
| Microsoft Works 8                    | Yes\*    |
  
\***Note** If the system uses Microsoft Update for update scanning and can access Microsoft Update (which a scan report can determine), MBSA 2.1 will detect Microsoft Works 8. However, if the system is managed by WSUS or is in an offline secure environment, which forces the system to use the WSUSSCN2.CAB offline catalog, MBSA 2.1 will not detect Microsoft Works 8.
  
For more information about MBSA 2.1, see [MBSA 2.1 Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsa2/qa.mspx).
  
**Note** For customers using legacy software not supported by MBSA 2.1, Microsoft Update, and Windows Server Update Services: please visit [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/tools/mbsahome.mspx) and reference the Legacy Product Support section on how to create comprehensive security update detection with legacy tools.
  
**Windows Server Update Services**
  
By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000. For more information about how to deploy this security update using Windows Server Update Services, visit the [Windows Server Update Services Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120).

This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
After you install the update, you cannot remove it. To revert to an installation before the update was installed; you must remove the application, and then install it again from the original media.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Office, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the “Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer” heading under the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance,** earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your computer. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en) Redistributable  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337)Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch                    | Description                                                                                                         |  
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?** or **/help**       | Displays usage dialog.                                                                                              |  
| **/passive**              | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel.           |  
| **/quiet**                | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/norestart**            | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart.                                                  |  
| **/forcerestart**         | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |  
| **/extract**              | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder.                                   |  
| **/extract:&lt;path&gt;** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/lang:&lt;LCID&gt;**    | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language.                              |  
| **/log:&lt;log file&gt;** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation.                                        |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
