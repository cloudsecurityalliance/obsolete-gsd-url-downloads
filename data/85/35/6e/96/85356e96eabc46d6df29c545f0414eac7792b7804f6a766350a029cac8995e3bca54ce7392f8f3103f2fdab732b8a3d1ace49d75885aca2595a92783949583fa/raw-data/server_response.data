I. OVERVIEW

    Perl is a free software scripting language interpreter providing a
    rich set of features provided as part of the base AIX Operating
    System environment.

II. DESCRIPTION

    The Digest module for Perl is prone to a vulnerability that will let
    attackers inject and execute arbitrary Perl code.

    Remote attackers can exploit this issue to run arbitrary code in the
    context of the affected application.

    Digest versions prior to 1.17 are affected.

        IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
        of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
        readable before proceeding.

        These interim fixes have not been fully regression tested;
        thus, IBM does not warrant the fully correct functionality of
        the interim fix.
        
        Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

        The checksums below were generated using the "sum", "cksum",
        "csum -h MD5" (md5sum), and "csum -h SHA1" (sha1sum) commands
        and are as follows:

        sum         filename
        ------------------------------------
        55198     9 IV10197610.111107.epkg.Z
        15391     9 IV10197710.111107.epkg.Z

        cksum             filename

        To verify the sums, use the text of this advisory as input to
        csum, md5sum, or sha1sum. For example:

        csum -h SHA1 -i Advisory.asc
        md5sum -c Advisory.asc
        sha1sum -c Advisory.asc

        These sums should match exactly. The PGP signatures in the
        compressed tarball and on this advisory can also be used to
        verify the integrity of the various files they correspond to.
        If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, double check
        the command results and the download site address.  If those
        are OK, contact IBM AIX Security at
        security-alert@austin.ibm.com and describe the discrepancy.

    C. INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION

        These packages use the new Interim Fix Management Solution to
        install and manage interim fixes.  More information can be
        found at:

        http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html

        To preview an epkg interim fix installation execute the
        following command:

        # emgr -e ipkg_name -p       # where ipkg_name is the name of the
                                     # interim fix package being previewed.

        To install an epkg interim fix package, execute the following
        command:

        # emgr -e ipkg_name -X       # where ipkg_name is the name of the
                                     # interim fix package being installed.

        The "X" flag will expand any filesystems if required.
