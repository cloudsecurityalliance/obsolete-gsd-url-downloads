<h2 id="cumulative-security-update-for-internet-explorer-916281">Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (916281)</h2>
<p>Published: June 13, 2006 | Updated: June 14, 2006</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p><strong>Who should read this document:</strong> Customers who use Microsoft Windows</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Vulnerability:</strong> Remote Code Execution</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Severity Rating:</strong> Critical</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Customers should apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Security Update Replacement:</strong> This bulletin replaces several prior security updates. See the frequently asked questions (FAQ) section of this bulletin for the complete list.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/916281" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 916281</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/916281" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 916281</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft is releasing an additional security update included with <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=66975" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-023: Vulnerability in Microsoft JScript Could Allow Remote Code Execution (917344)</a>. We recommend that you install both security updates at the same time as an update in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=66973" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-021: Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (916281)</a> could expose the JScript vulnerability or cause application compatibility issues.</li>
<li>This security update also replaces the cumulative update for Internet Explorer that was released on February 28, 2006. For more information about this update, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a>.</li>
<li>This security update also replaces the compatibility patch released on April 11, 2006. That compatibility patch temporarily returned Internet Explorer to the previous functionality for handling ActiveX controls, to help enterprise customers who needed more time to prepare for the ActiveX update changes discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a>. This security update replaces that compatibility patch, and makes the changes in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a> permanent. For more information about these changes, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a> and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/" data-linktype="external">product documentation</a>.</li>

<p>The software in this list has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The security updates for Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, and Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition also apply to Windows Server 2003 R2.</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This update resolves several newly discovered, publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own “Vulnerability Details” section of this bulletin.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> This security update also replaces the compatibility patch released on April 11, 2006. That compatibility patch temporarily returned Internet Explorer to the previous functionality for handling ActiveX controls, to help enterprise customers who needed more time to prepare for the ActiveX update changes discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a>. This security update replaces that compatibility patch, and makes the changes in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a> permanent. For more information about these changes, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a> and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ieupdate/" data-linktype="external">product documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What are the known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update?</strong><br/>

<p><strong>What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a> is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the <strong>Security</strong> tab and the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security level for the Internet zone is set to <strong>High</strong>. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.</li>
<li>Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.</li>
<li>Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.</li>
<li>Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vulnerability-details">Vulnerability Details</h2>
<h4 id="exception-handling-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-2218">Exception Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2218:</h4>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer handles exceptional conditions. As a result, system memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code if a user visited a specially crafted Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-exception-handling-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-2218">Mitigating Factors for Exception Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2218:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they user could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018</a> has been installed.
<strong>Note</strong> While it cannot be ruled out that this vulnerability could be used in an exploit without Active Scripting, it significantly increases the chances of a successful exploit. As a result, this vulnerability has been given a severity rating of Critical.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration for Outlook Express. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-exception-handling-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-2218">Workarounds for Exception Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2218:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> While it cannot be ruled out that this vulnerability could be used in an exploit without Active Scripting, it significantly increases the chances of a successful exploit. As a result, this vulnerability has been given a severity rating of Critical.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-exception-handling-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-2218">FAQ for Exception Handling Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2218:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer allows objects to register exception handlers that may not properly handle certain conditions. Unsafe exception handling can cause memory corruption resulting in remote code execution.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>Could this vulnerability be exploited through e-mail?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail or while viewing e-mail messages in the preview pane while using Outlook or Outlook Express. Customers would have to click a link that would take them to a specially crafted Web site, or open an attachment that could exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by changing the way that Internet Explorer does exception handling. Specifically, exception handlers are removed from Internet Explorer with this update. These exception handlers were previously removed from Internet Explorer 7 and Windows Vista.</p>
<p><strong>What might the removal of these exception handlers result in?</strong><br/>
With the removal of these exception handlers, exceptions from objects that do not handle their own exception, which were previously caught within the Internet Explorer process may now result in application faults. These application faults could cause Internet Explorer to fail. The object or software where the application fault occurs now needs to either address the cause of the application fault or handle its own exception.</p>
<p><strong>What can I do to prevent these application faults?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=66975" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-023: Vulnerability in Microsoft JScript Could Allow Remote Code Execution (917344)</a> addresses the cause of the application fault in JScript. Other objects, software, or Web application where application faults may occur as a result of the changes made in Microsoft security bulletin MS06-021 now needs to either address the cause of the application fault or handle its own exception.</p>
<p><strong>What is exception handling and how can I implement it?</strong><br/>
Robust code anticipates and handles exceptions. Exceptions occur when a program executes abnormally because of conditions outside the program's control. Certain operations, including object creation and file input/output, are subject to failures that go beyond errors. Out-of-memory conditions, for example, can occur even when your program is running correctly. For more information about exception handling see the product documentation:</p>

<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK.</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls.

These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer</strong><br/>
You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.</p>
<p>For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>To set the kill bit for the DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Light ActiveX control, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{F9EFBEC2-4302-11D2-952A-00C04FA34F05}]

<h4 id="workarounds-for-com-object-instantiation-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1303">Workarounds for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1303:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK.</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.</p>
<p>For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>For example, to set the kill bit for a CLSID in the Wmm2fxa.dll file that is included in this security update, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{B4DC8DD9-2CC1-4081-9B2B-20D7030234EF}]
&quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400</p>
<p>You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-com-object-instantiation-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1303">FAQ for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1303:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When Internet Explorer tries to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX Controls, the COM objects may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Customers who have installed the security update included with <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50690" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-052</a> or a later security bulletin for Internet Explorer are not at risk from attacks originating from the Internet zone.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
Because not all COM objects are designed to be accessed through Internet Explorer, this update sets the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">kill bit</a> for a list of Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) for COM objects that have been found to exhibit similar behavior to the COM object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability that is addressed in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=53511" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-054</a>. To help protect customers, this update prevents these CLSIDs from being instantiated in Internet Explorer. For more information about kill bits, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>.</p>

<h4 id="css-cross-domain-information-disclosure-vulnerability---cve-2005-4089">CSS Cross-Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4089:</h4>
<p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because it incorrectly interprets a specially crafted document as a cascading style sheet (CSS). An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that could potentially lead to information disclosure if a user visited a specially crafted Web site or clicked a link in a specially crafted e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read file data from another Internet Explorer domain. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-css-cross-domain-information-disclosure-vulnerability---cve-2005-4089">Mitigating Factors for CSS Cross-Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2005-4089:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to file data from a system other than that of the attacker’s Web site.</li>
<li>The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.
By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018</a> has been installed.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration for Outlook Express. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>

<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read data from another security zone or domain in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>What are Internet Explorer security zones?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360" data-linktype="external">security zones</a> are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones, based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is put in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site.

<h4 id="workarounds-for-address-bar-spoofing-vulnerability---cve-2006-2384">Workarounds for Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-2384:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality.

<p><strong>Notes</strong> When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Version Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key.</p>
<p>Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003 R2, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter x64 Edition:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB916281\Filelist</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 916281 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
<h4 id="windows-xp-service-pack-2-all-versions-and-windows-xp-professional-x64">Windows XP Service Pack 2 (all versions) and Windows XP Professional x64</h4>

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
<p><strong>Deployment Information</strong></p>
<p>To install the security update without any user intervention, use the following command at a command prompt for Microsoft Windows XP:</p>
<p><strong>Windowsxp-kb916281-x86-enu /quiet</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Use of the <strong>/quiet</strong> switch will suppress all messages. This includes suppressing failure messages. Administrators should use one of the supported methods to verify the installation was successful when they use the <strong>/quiet</strong> switch. Administrators should also review the KB916281.log file for any failure messages when they use this switch.</p>
<p>To install the security update without forcing the system to restart, use the following command at a command prompt for Windows XP:</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong> When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Version Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.</p>
<p>Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB916281\Filelist</p>
<p>Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB916281\Filelist</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 916281 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
<h4 id="internet-explorer-6-service-pack-1-for-windows-xp-service-pack-1-all-versions-and-windows-2000-all-versions">Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 for Windows XP Service Pack 1 (all versions) and Windows 2000 (all versions)</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br/>
To install the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (SP1) version of this update, you must be running Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (version 6.00.2800.1106) on one of the following versions of Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4</li>
<li>Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1</li>
</ul>
<p>The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about how to obtain the latest service pack, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/260910" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 260910</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Inclusion in Future Service Packs:</strong><br/>
The update for this issue may be included in a future Update Rollup.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong> When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.<br/>
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File Version Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 6\SP1\KB916281-IE6SP1-20060526.162249\Filelist</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 916281 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
<h4 id="internet-explorer-501-service-pack-4-on-windows-2000-all-versions">Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 on Windows 2000 (all versions)</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br/>
For Windows 2000, this security update requires Service Pack 4 (SP4). For Small Business Server 2000, this security update requires Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).</p>
<p>The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Software Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133" data-linktype="external">Software Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Server Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120" data-linktype="external">Windows Server Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Management Server:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack</a> and in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161" data-linktype="external">SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack</a>) to install these updates.</p>
