<TD>Avaya Aura&reg; Communication Manager</TD>
<TD>6.3.x, 7.0 thru 7.1.3</TD>
<TD>Upgrade to 7.1.3.1 or later.</TD>
<TD>
Avaya Aura R6 is in <A HREF="https://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/101033017">End of Manufacturer Support</A>. Due to this, it is recommended that customers migrate to 7.1.3.1 or later releases.<BR><BR>
The risk is mitigated since this vulnerability can only be exploited by an administrative level user.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P><B>Recommended Actions for System Products:</B><BR>Avaya strongly recommends following networking and 
security best practices by implementing firewalls, ACLs, 
physical security or other appropriate access restrictions. 
Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in 
place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network 
from this potential vulnerability may be mitigated by 
ensuring these practices are implemented until such time as 
an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya 
action is applied. 
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the 
customer's security policies may be required during this 
interim period, but the System Product operating system or 
application should not be modified unless the change is 
approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved may 
void the Avaya product service contract.</P>

<H3>CVSS 3.0 Scoring and Metrics:</H3>
<P>Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3 
(CVSSv3) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected 
component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSSv3 base score and metrics.  Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSSv3 scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment. For more information on CVSS and how the score is calculated, see
