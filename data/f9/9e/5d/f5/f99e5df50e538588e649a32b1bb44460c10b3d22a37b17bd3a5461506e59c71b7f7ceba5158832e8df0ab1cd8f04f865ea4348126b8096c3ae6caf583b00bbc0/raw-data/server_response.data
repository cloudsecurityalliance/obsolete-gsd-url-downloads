<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-the-opentype-font-otf-driver-could-allow-remote-code-execution-2296199">Vulnerabilities in the OpenType Font (OTF) Driver Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2296199)</h2>
<p>Published: December 14, 2010</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in the Windows Open Type Font (OTF) driver that could allow remote code execution. An attacker could host a specially crafted OpenType font on a network share. The affected control path is then triggered when the user navigates to the share in Windows Explorer, allowing the specially crafted font to take complete control over an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2. This security update is also rated Important for all supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that the OpenType Font (OTF) driver indexes arrays when parsing OpenType fonts, resets pointers when freeing memory, and parses the CMAP table when rendering OpenType fonts. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> None</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

OpenType Font Index Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3956  
-------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the OpenType Font (OTF) driver improperly parses specially crafted OpenType fonts. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-3956](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-3956).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for OpenType Font Index Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3956
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
  
#### Workarounds for OpenType Font Index Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3956
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer**
  
    Disabling the Preview and Details panes in Windows Explorer prevents OTF fonts from being viewed in Windows Explorer. While this prevents malicious files from being viewed in Windows Explorer, it does not prevent a local, authenticated user from running a specially crafted program to exploit this vulnerability. To disable these panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, perform the following steps:
  
    1.  Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.  
    2.  Clear both the **Details pane** and **Preview pane** menu options.  
    3.  Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.
  
    **Impact of workaround.**  Windows Explorer will not display OTF fonts.
  
    **How to undo the workaround.**
  
    To re-enable the Windows Explorer Preview and Details panes in Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2:
  
    1.  Open Windows Explorer, click **Organize**, and then click **Layout**.  
    2.  Select both the **Details pane** and **Preview pane** menu options.  
    3.  Close all open instances of Windows Explorer for the change to take effect.
  
#### FAQ for OpenType Font Index Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3956
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability is caused when the OpenType Font (OTF) driver does not properly index an array when parsing OpenType fonts.
  
**What is the OpenType Font format?**   
OpenType is a font format developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe as an extension of Apple's TrueType font format. An OpenType font file contains data, in table format, that comprises either a TrueType or a PostScript outline font. Rasterizers use combinations of data from the tables contained in the font to render the TrueType or PostScript glyph outlines. For more information, see the [Microsoft Typography OpenType FAQ](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/opentypefaq.mspx).
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 systems, an attacker could host a specially crafted OpenType font on a network share. Then, when the user navigates to the share in Windows Explorer, the affected control path is triggered via the Details and Preview panes. The specially crafted OpenType font could then exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over an affected system.
  
On Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems, to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over an affected system.
  
**Are third-party Web browsers affected by this vulnerability?**   
Yes. Third-party Web browsers are affected by this vulnerability if they natively render OpenType fonts. For these applications, this vulnerability may allow remote code execution in the context of the logged on user if used to view a Web site with an embedded, specially crafted OpenType font. By default, Internet Explorer is not affected by this issue.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**Can this vulnerability be remotely exploited in Windows XP or Windows Server 2003?**   
No. On these systems, OpenType fonts are not previewed automatically in Windows Explorer. To successfully exploit this vulnerability on these systems, an attacker would first have to log on to the local system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over an affected system.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the OpenType Font (OTF) driver indexes an array when parsing OpenType fonts.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

#### FAQ for OpenType Font Double Free Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3957
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability is caused when the OpenType Font (OTF) driver does not properly reset a pointer when freeing memory. This results in a "double free" condition.
  
**What is a "double free" condition?**   
A double free condition is a condition in which a program is caused to release or free allocated memory more than once. Releasing memory that has already been freed could lead to memory corruption. An attacker could add arbitrary code to memory that is then executed when the corruption occurs. This code could then be executed at a system level of privilege.
  
Typically, this vulnerability causes a denial of service to occur. However, in some circumstances, it could cause code execution to occur. Because of the unique layout of the memory on each affected system, exploiting this vulnerability on a mass scale could be difficult.
  
**What is the OpenType Font format?**   
OpenType is a font format developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe as an extension of Apple's TrueType font format. An OpenType font file contains data, in table format, that comprises either a TrueType or a PostScript outline font.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**
  
Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang=en).
  
The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

<h4 id="deployment-information">Deployment Information</h4>
<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the installer, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475</a>.</p>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).
  
For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see "Windows Update Stand-alone Installer" in the TechNet article, [Miscellaneous Changes in Windows 7](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd871148(ws.10).aspx).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
        **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    4.  You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.  
    5.  Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
