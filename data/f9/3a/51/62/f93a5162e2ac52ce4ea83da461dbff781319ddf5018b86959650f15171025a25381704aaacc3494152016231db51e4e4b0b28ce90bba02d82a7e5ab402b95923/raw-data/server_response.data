User-controlled configuration options used by GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to read files on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior to 3.1.8 and was fixed in 3.1.8, 3.0.16, and 2.22.22. This is the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-22867. This vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program and has been assigned CVE-2021-22868. </p></li><li class="f4"><p><strong>MEDIUM:</strong> An improper access control vulnerability in GitHub Enterprise Server allowed a workflow job to execute in a self-hosted runner group it should not have had access to. This affects customers using self-hosted runner groups for access control. A repository with access to one enterprise runner group could access all of the enterprise runner groups within the organization because of improper authentication checks during the request. This could cause code to be run unintentionally by the incorrect runner group. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server versions from 3.0.0 to 3.0.15 and 3.1.0 to 3.1.7 and was fixed in 3.0.16 and 3.1.8 releases. It has been assigned CVE-2021-22869. </p></li></ul></div><div class="py-6 d-block d-xl-flex gutter-xl flex-items-baseline border-bottom"><div class="col-12 col-xl-3 mb-5"><span class="px-3 py-2 text-small text-bold text-uppercase color-bg-emphasis color-fg-on-emphasis">Bug fixes</span></div><ul class="col-xl-9 col-12"><li class="f4"><p>Resque worker counts were displayed incorrectly during maintenance mode. </p></li><li class="f4"><p>Allocated memcached memory could be zero in clustering mode. </p></li><li class="f4"><p>Non-empty binary files displayed an incorrect file type and size on the pull request "Files" tab. </p></li><li class="f4"><p>Fixes GitHub Pages builds so they take into account the NO_PROXY setting of the appliance.

<ul>
<li>GitHub Advanced Security customers can now view their active committer count and the remaining number of unused committer seats on their organization or enterprise account’s Billing page. If Advanced Security is purchased for an enterprise, administrators can also view the active committer seats which are being used by other organizations within their enterprise. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/advanced-security/about-licensing-for-github-advanced-security">About GitHub Advanced Security licensing</a>" and "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.1/admin/advanced-security/viewing-your-github-advanced-security-usage">Viewing your GitHub Advanced Security usage</a>."</li>
<li>GitHub Advanced Security customers can now view their active committer count for any Advanced Security enabled repositories on their organization or enterprise account's Billing page. These changes help billing administrators track their usage against how many committer licenses they purchased.

<ul>
<li>Users with Dependabot alerts enabled can see which of their repositories are impacted by a given vulnerability by navigating to its entry in the <a href="https://github.com/advisories">GitHub Advisory Database</a>. This feature is available in public beta. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/supply-chain-security/viewing-and-updating-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository">Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository</a>."</li>
<li>When a vulnerability is added to GitHub Advisory Database, you will no longer receive <a href="https://github.com/notifications">email and web notifications</a> for Dependabot alerts on low and moderate severity vulnerabilities. These alerts are still accessible from the repository's Security tab. For more information, see "<a href="/en/enterprise-server@3.1/code-security/supply-chain-security/viewing-and-updating-vulnerable-dependencies-in-your-repository">Viewing and updating vulnerable dependencies in your repository</a>."</li>
<li>You can now give people instructions on how to responsibly report security vulnerabilities in your project by adding a <code>SECURITY.md</code> file to your repository's <code>root</code>, <code>docs</code>, or <code>.github</code> folder. When someone creates an issue in your repository, they will see a link to your project's security policy.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
