        <!--<br><p>This is a teeny-tiny release (that’s why it is numbered like a hotfix).
It does fix a recent regression in the <em>partition</em> module, where
a pop-up message asks you to create a gargantuan EFI partition.
The message is supposed to say “300 MiB”, but expresses 300 MiB in bytes,
so it’s off by a factor of a million (more, even).</p>

The Calamares project has participated <a href="/calamares-hacktoberfest/">before</a>
and we’ve seen some small benefits from it. This year, the rules have
tightened to be stricter on spam pull-requests (in 2020 we got a couple),
and I’m glad of that. Potential contributors can check out the
<a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ahacktoberfest">list of good starter-issues</a>.
Most of those issues have a checklist to help new folks along.
The checklist should take you from “get Calamares to run at all” through to “submit a PR that can be merged”.</p>

even, on code paths that apparently – and fortunately – nobody
is using. The release scripts now run <em>pylint</em> as part of
the release process to check for obvious problems. Those problems
should have been obvious – with enough eyes on them anyway –
before, but now the machine does part of the looking for us.</p>

important for certain distributions, and have no effect on others.
And then, after a few hours, a hot-fix release for a typo
introduced as “internal code fix”. So enjoy Calamares 3.2.44.1.
We’ll be looking into integrating better tools to avoid typo’s
in Python modules in upcoming releases.</p>

        <!--<br><p>This release has remarkably little user-visible change in it,
<strong>unless</strong> you are looking for better translation coverage,
for instance when starting Calamares in Russian and switching to
Chinese. For your typing please, the <em>keyboardq</em> module (used
by KaOS) now offers keyboard layout previews.</p>

        <!--<br><p>After a summer break, we return to short-cycle releases
where the Calamares team does a release roughly every two weeks
with the bugfixes and improvements from that time.
The Calamares team is happy to
release Calamares 3.2.42. The milestone remains open,
but this release has bugfixes for keyboard and partitioning
and new features in the welcome, summary and packagechooser modules,
as well as other areas.</p>

August: vacation and other meetings mean that there are
<strong>no</strong> short-cycle releases expected until early September.
Development will pick up as usual at the end of August.
In the meantime, things are in the capable hands of
Calamares-using distributions like KaOS, Manjaro, and ArcoLinux.</p>

        <!--<br><p>Calamares 3.2.41.1 has been released. This is a <strong>hot-fix</strong> release for
a regression in the partitioning module. Calamares crashes on startup
if certain partitioning conditions are met. Reported by KDE neon users.</p>

        <!--<br><p>Returning to short-cycle releases, the Calamares team is happy to
release Calamares 3.2.41. The “things that fit” into this release
do not cover all of the items on the milestone, which will remain
open for a few more releases until all the milestone issues are
resolved.</p>

 -->

        <!--<br><p>If it doesn’t rain, things dry up. Calamares 3.2.40 took
too long to get out the door, largely a consequence of
having a number of big-ticket things on the milestone
along with lots of little fiddly bits.</p>

<p>As a 3-months-long-release, this one has many more changes
than the short-cycle releases from earlier in the 3.2 series.
We expect to return to short-cycle – simply because that
works better. We have several new contributors who helped
to improve Calamares.</p>

 -->
    
        <li><a href="/communications2/">Communications Channels Again</a></li>
        <!--<br><p>Calamares, like many Free Software projects, has been
using IRC for many years for real-time communication, for idle chit-chat and 
for community-building. We now <strong>primarily</strong> use <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#calamares:kde.org</code>)
and <strong>secondarily</strong> the <a href="https://libera.chat/">Libera.Chat</a> IRC network (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#calamares</code>).
The Freenode channel that was the chatroom of the project from its
start in 2014 is no longer controlled, operated, or monitored by
the Calamares team.</p>

        <!--<br><p>Calamares serves the needs of several dozen Linux distributions,
large and small, based on any one of the “big five” distro’s, with
whatever desktop environment users would like. Two new faces
(both Arch-derivatives) have joined the club this month, so let’s give them a bit
of spotlight.</p>

 -->
    
        <li><a href="/communications/">Communications Channels</a></li>
        <!--<br><p>Calamares, like many Free Software projects, has been
using IRC – and the Freenode network – for many years
for real-time communication, for idle chit-chat and

has encouraged the Calamares team to diversify the communication
channels.</p>

for me but probably other seasons elsewhere in the world –
Calamares participated in <a href="https://season.kde.org/">Season of KDE</a>,
which is a participate-in-KDE activity. While Calamares is not a
KDE project, there is enough KDE code used <em>by</em> Calamares to call
it KDE-adjacent, and so we tagged along.</p>

        <!--<br><p>A minor bugfix tweak release. Since this contains yet <strong>another</strong>
autologin-related fix, and there is nothing large enough to justify
a 3.2.40 release yet, add it to the growing tail of 3.2.39. (Reported
by Joe Kamprad, #1672). Also fixes a regression from 3.2.28 in
localized packages (e.g. <em>package-LOCALE</em> did not work).</p>

a mismatch between the <em>users</em> module and the <em>displaymanager</em> module
prevents autologin from being configured. The list of (partly)
supported desktop environments for <em>displaymanager</em> has been expanded as well.
Improvements supplied by, and bug reports from, Erik Dubois. Thank you!</p>

that something mentioned in the changelog was not included in
the released tarball. So we get a new release,
<strong>with</strong> all the bits promised for 3.2.38 and some
translation updates and minor bugfixes to boot.</p>

you pick whichever one you like) there is Calamares 3.2.38.
There are new modules, module improvements, and some under-the-hood
fixes. The milestone for 3.2.37 still isn’t empty, so we will keep
using that until it’s done.</p>

second release that does not add a whole lot, but let’s get it out
the door anyway. It is feature-light, although users in Belarus

reuse the current milestone.</p>

provides (for free!) to Open Source projects, so Calamares is moving
its CI elsewhere.</p>

    <p align="right"><b><small>Jul 6, 2019</small></b></p>
<p>Systems installed by Calamares up to and including Calamares 3.2.10
may leak cryptographic keys via lax file permissions on initramfs files.
This may allow unprivileged users to obtain the decryption keys for encrypted
disks.</p>

<p>In addition, during installation by Calamares up to and including Calamares 3.2.10
there is a window of opportunity for reading cryptographic keys via lax file permissions.
This may allow unprivileged users to obtain the decryption keys for encrypted disks.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It has been almost exactly two years since the <a href="/calamares-cve">last CVE for Calamares</a>.
This time, there are two ways to leak the cryptographic keys used to encrypt disks using LUKS.</p>

<h2 id="umask">umask</h2>

<p>Under POSIX, a file’s permissions are given by three groups of
file permission bits; the groups give permissions for the owner, group and other
users of the systems. A file which gives read-permission to others is, of course,
readable by everyone on the system.</p>

<p>Under POSIX, a process has a so-called <em>umask</em>, which are bits that are <strong>switched off</strong>
when creating a file. In particular, a umask value of 077 (that is octal, so it is
three zero bits, followed by six one bits) switches off group and other permissions,
so creating a file with that umask set will yield a file that is not readable by
others. A umask of 077 is “safe”.</p>

<p>For more explanation of file permissions bits,
please see the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Permissions">Debian wiki on permissions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="key-file-permissions">Key File Permissions</h2>

<p>(
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13178">CVE-2019-13178</a>
<a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1190">#1190</a>
)</p>

<p>A key file for LUKS encryption is generated by Calamares. This key file is
sensitive information, because it is used to encrypt the hard disk where
the installation takes place, and an attacker with access to the key file can
use that to defeat disk encryption.</p>

<p>The generation of the key file in Calamares versions up to 3.2.10 is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>generate the key file,</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> the key file to 0600 (readable by user/owner only).</li>
</ul>

<p>When the file is generated, there is a window of opportunity between
generation and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> to read the file, <strong>if</strong> the file is generated
with lax permissions.</p>

<p>To exploit this, an attacker must be logged in to the machine
that is being installed, during installation, and the file must
be generated with lax permissions. Most Live CDs seem to use
an unsafe umask of 022, allowing the file to be created with
permissions 0644. In the brief instant that the file exists
but has not had the permissions changed to 0600, it could be
read by an attacker.</p>

<p>Calamares now explicitly sets the umask to a safe value
before creating the key file. (An additional mitigation,
creating the file with explicit permissions 0600 instead
of relying on umask, will be added in a later Calamares release).</p>

<p>Distributions are encouraged, in addition, to set a safe umask for
the root user, or to set a safe umask during installation.</p>

<h2 id="initramfs-information-leak">Initramfs Information Leak</h2>

<p>(
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-13179">CVE-2019-13179</a>
<a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1191">#1191</a>
)</p>

<p>Most Linux systems boot using an <em>initial ramfs</em>, containing tools, drivers, and
data used during system boot. For an encrypted hard disk, that data includes
the key file that is used to encrypt the hard disk. The initial ramfs is
generally stored on an encrypted boot partition, but it is a regular file
once the system has booted. If an attacker can read the initial ramfs file,
the attacker can extract the key file from the initial ramfs – it is not
otherwise encrypted on-disk.</p>

<p>After installation, any user on the installed system may be able
to read the initial ramfs (if it installed with vulnerable permissions),
and extract the key information. Unless something changes the permissions
on the initial ramfs file, this vulnerability persists across reboots
and any user with access to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/boot</code> directory (where initial ramfs files live)
can obtain the key.</p>

<p>The generation of the initial ramfs is done through tools external
to Calamares. Depending on the distribution,</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>update-initramfs</em> (generally, Debian derivatives)</li>
  <li><em>mkinitcpio</em> (generally, Arch derivatives)</li>
  <li><em>dracut</em> (generally, Fedora derivatives)
one of these three tools is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users of <em>dracut</em> are
not vulnerable, as it has had code in place for CVE-2012-4453
for many years. It sets umask 077 before generating the initial ramfs,
and the resulting file is not readable for others.</p>

<p>Users of <em>mkinitcpio</em> may be vulnerable, since it uses the umask
when generating new files. Most Live CDs that use <em>mkinitcpio</em> seem
to have an unsafe umask of 022 set, so that the resulting file
is readable by others. Calamares now sets a safe umask before
generating the file, <strong>and</strong> actively changes the permissions on
initial ramfs files to a safe value during installation.</p>

<p>Users of <em>update-initramfs</em> may be vulnerable, since it requires
explicit configuration to set a umask. If there is no explicit
configuration, the tool uses an unsafe umask value of 022
<strong>regardless</strong> of the environment’s umask setting. Most installed
systems seem to have no explicit setting, and the initial ramfs file
is readable by others. Calamares now <strong>intrusively</strong> adds
a configuration snippet that sets a safe umask before creating
the initial ramfs.</p>

<h2 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h2>

<p>For installated systems with a potentially vulnerable initial ramfs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>set a safe umask for the root user,</li>
  <li>change the permissions of initial ramfs files in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/boot</code> to a
safe value,</li>
  <li>(for users of <em>update-initramfs</em>) add a configuration snippet
to set the umask to a safe value when creating initial ramfs files.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="distributions">Distributions</h2>

<p>A new Calamares version, 3.2.11, has been released.
It contains code to address both weaknesses:
the key file is generated safely.
Initial ramfs files are generated with a safe umask
and with an additional safe configuration snippet.</p>

<p>The default configuration for Calamares in version 3.2.11 is
to use safe settings. It is possible for distributions to
disable the safe-settings with an explicit choice in the
configuration files – this may be sensible if the distribution
has <strong>other</strong> mitigations (in particular for <em>update-initramfs</em>)
in place.</p>

<p>Existing ISO images, of course, contain vulnerable installation code
and will continue to do so until new ISO images are released.</p>
