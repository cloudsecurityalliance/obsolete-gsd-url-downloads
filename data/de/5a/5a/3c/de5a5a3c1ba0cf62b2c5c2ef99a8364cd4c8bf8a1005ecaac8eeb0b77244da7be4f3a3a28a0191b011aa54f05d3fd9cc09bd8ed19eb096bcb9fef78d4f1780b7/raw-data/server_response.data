<li>Multi-arch docker images</li>
    <li> Appropriate tags based on the build information </li>
  <li> Dockpushes directly to dockerhub.</li>
  </ul></li>

<h3 id="Deprecated21.04">Announcements, Deprecations and Breaking Changes</h3>
<ul>

    <li>dotCMS 21.04 still requires Java 8 in order to run properly.  That said, we expect that within the next 3 months, dotCMS will be deprecating support for Java 8 and instead require Java 11 to run. We will keep the community posted.</li>
    <li>Breaking Change: The UserProxy table in the database is now deprecated. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>The table is still available, but no new data will be added to it starting in this release and the get method will no longer work. </li>
            <li> The UserProxy table will be removed all together within the next 3 months. </li>
        </ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="Changes21.04"> Changes in dotCMS 21.04</h3>
Push publishing authentication now uses API tokens.  This means that it is no longer necessary to configure the “receiver” in a Push Publish architecture, just have a valid admin token. 
<ul><li>If you are upgrading, any existing push publishing configuration will continue to work normally and will be maintained.  </li>
<li>There is a `Get Token` utility on the Endpoint screen that can be used to generate and retrieve a valid token from the receiving server.</li>
<li>To change Push Publishing Environments to use the "Receive From" configuration instead of automated authorization tokens, set the following `USE_JWT_TOKEN_IN_PUSH_PUBLISH` in the `dotmarketing-config.properties` file to `FALSE`. </li>
</ul>

<!--<h3 id="NewFeatures21.04">New Features</h3>

<p>The following new features have been added in dotCMS 21.04:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new Tool called "Getting Started" has been added to dotCMS. </li> <ul> <li>The tool will be shown when admins log into dotCMS for the first time.</li> <li> This tool will supply admins with relavant examples and resources to get started with dotCMS quickly and easily.</li><li>Admins will be able to dismiss this tool if they don't feel they need it.</li></ul>

See <a href="#AdditionalImprovements21.03" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Improvements in dotCMS Section</a> for more information.</li>

    <li>This version of dotCMS ships with Tomcat 9. Any plugins or overrides that specify files in the tomcat directory tomcat-8.5.32 will need to be updated.</li>
    <li>dotCMS 21.03 still requires Java 8 in order to run properly.  That said, we expect that within the next 3 months, dotCMS will be deprecating support for Java 8 and instead require Java 11 to run. We will keep the community posted.</li>

<h4><font color="red">Important:</font></h4>
<p>dotCMS 5.3.3 includes an important fix for a critical security vulnerability.  This vulnerability has already been mitigated for existing dotCMS Enterprise and dotCMS Cloud customers.  However, if you are a Community Edition customer, it is strongly recommended that you upgrade to dotCMS 5.3.3 as soon as possible.</p>
--></p>
<p><b>This release includes a number of changes which may affect existing installations</b>. We recommend that you read through this changelog in full before upgrading any existing installations.</p>
<h3 id="ImportantChanges5.3.3"><b>Important Changes</b></h3>
<p>A number of important changes in dotCMS 5.3.3 configuration may impact your performance when upgrading an existing site. Please read the documentation sections on all of these changes before upgrading from a previous release.</p>
<h4 id="ConfigurationChanges5.3.3">Configuration Changes</h4>
<p>The following important changes have been made to configuration in dotCMS 5.3.3:</p>
<ul>
<li>The "Push Now" Workflow Sub-Action now allows you to specify a <a href="/docs/latest/push-publishing-filters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push Publishing Filter</a> (see below)</li>
<ul>
<li>Existing "Push Now" Sub-Actions will use whichever filter is defined as the default filter.</li>
<li>By default, this will preserve the Push Publishing behavior of previous versions</li>
<ul>
<li>However, if you modify your Push Publishing Filters to change which filter is used as the default filter, the "Push Now" Sub-Actions will change to use the new default filter.</li>
</ul>
<li>You may change each "Push Now" Sub-Action to specify a filter by name, instead of using the default filter.</li>
</ul>
<li>The Vanity URL cache regions have changed</li>
<ul>
<li>Vanity URLs continue to work the same as they have in previous versions, but the underlying code has been significantly updated to improve performance and reliability.</li>
<li>As part of this change, there are now two different cache regions for Vanity URLs: <code>vanityurlsitecache</code> and <code>vanityurldirectcache</code>.</li>
<ul>
<li>The <code>vanityurlsitecache</code> region stores a separate list of Vanity URLs for each host on your system</li>
<ul>
<li>The default size of 5000 should work for almost all dotCMS instances, but if you have thousands of sites on the same dotCMS instance, you should set this region to a size that's larger than the number of hosts you expect to have on your system.</li>
</ul>
<li>The <code>vanityurldirectcache</code> region stores the most recently matched Vanity URLs.</li>
<ul>
<li>The default size of 25000 will work for the majority of sites, but if your sites use Vanity URLs heavily, you may wish to monitor the cache statistics, and increase the size of this region appropriately if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><!--
<h4 id="DefaultBehaviorChanges5.3.3">Changes to Default Behavior</h4>

<p>The following differences in default behavior in dotCMS 5.3.3 may change your expectations and require a review of your administration practices. Please review all of these changes before upgrading from a previous release.</p>

--></p>
<p>The following new features have been added in dotCMS 5.3.3:</p>
<ul>
<li>New <b>Push Publishing Filters</b> enable you to selectively limit which types of content and dependencies are pushed to a receiving environment</li>
<ul>
<li>You may create different filters, to give your users a choice of how to push content.</li>
<li>You may give different permissions to each filter, to limit the use of some filters by Role.</li>
<li>You may specify a default filter, which will be automatically selected, and which will be used by default in all existing Workflow Actions.</li>
<ul>
<li>When upgrading your site, the default filter will be set to the "Everything and Dependencies" filter, which pushes content with all dependencies, matching the behavior of pushes in earlier dotCMS versions.</li>
</ul>
<li>The dotCMS starter site includes a set of standard filters.</li>
<ul>
<li>When upgrading your site, these filters will be installed automatically.</li>

<h3 id="ImportantChanges5.3.0"><b>Important Changes</b></h3>
<p>A number of important changes in dotCMS 5.3.0 configuration may impact your performance when upgrading an existing site. Please read the documentation sections on all of these changes before upgrading from a previous release.</p>
<h4 id="ConfigurationChanges5.3.0">Configuration Changes</h4>
<p>The following important changes have been made to configuration in dotCMS 5.3.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dotCMS distribution files are now delivered as Docker images and Amazon AWS Images (AMIs), in addition to binary files.</li>
<ul>
<li>For the most seamless demonstration experience, dotCMS recommends Docker images for most new dotCMS users.</li>
<li>However experienced dotCMS users may still download the dotCMS binary distribution for installation and upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<li>The internal Elasticsearch server has been removed</li>
<ul>
<li>All dotCMS installations must now use an external Elasticsearch server.</li>
<li>All dotCMS Docker images include an external Elasticsearch server which is started and managed transparently by the Docker image.</li>
</ul>
<li>The main database configuration for dotCMS installations has been changed from the <code>context.xml</code> file to the <code>db.properties</code> file.</li>
<ul>
<li>The dotCMS distribution no longer ships with a <code>context.xml</code> file.</li>
<li>The <code>context.xml</code> file will still be used if no <code>db.properties</code> file exists, so the <code>context.xml</code> files of customers upgrading from earlier releases will continue to work without changes.</li>
<li>For more information on the new <code>db.properties</code> file, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/database-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Database Configuration documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Elasticsearch SSL/cert verification has disabled by default.</li>
<ul>
<li>This change was made to improve Elasticsearch security, by allowing Elasticsearch to use HTTPS protocol even when connecting to hosts which may not have a valid cert.</li>
<li>You may re-enable SSL/cert verification by setting the property <code>ES_TLS_ENABLED=true</code> in the <code>dotcms-config-cluster.properties</code> file.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h4 id="DefaultBehaviorChanges5.3.0">Changes to Default Behavior</h4>
<p>The following differences in default behavior in dotCMS 5.3.0 may change your expectations and require a review of your administration practices. Please review all of these changes before upgrading from a previous release.</p>
<ul><!--
    <li><b>Important:</b> Due to changes in Elasticsearch (details below), you must perform a <b>full reindex</b> of both the main dotCMS index and any Site Search indexes after upgrading from an earlier version of dotCMS.</li>
-->
<li>The default database configuration file has been changed from <b>context.xml</b> to <b>db.properties</b>.</li>
<ul>
<li>The <b>context.xml</b> file is still supported, but has been deprecated, and will stop being supported in a future release.</li>

</ul>
<!--    <li>The default starter site for new dotCMS installations is now an empty starter site.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The full dotCMS demo starter site is still included in the release distribution, and can be run by renaming the ??????.tzip file to <code>starter.zip</code>.</li>
        </ul>
-->
<li>A number of potential <b>Content Type variable names</b> have now been designated as reserved.</li>
<ul>
<li>If you create a new Content Type and the variable name resolves to one of these reserved names, the variable name will automatically be modified to prevent an exact match with the reserved name.</li>
<li>Existing Content Types which match these new reserved names will not be changed, but it is recommended that you consider changing Content Types with variables matching a reserved name, as the Content Type variable name may cause conflicts in some cases.</li>
<li>For more information on the list of reserved names for Content Types, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/content-types#VariableNameReserved" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Content Types documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>Changed the default value of the <b>H22 Cache Provider</b> recovery threshold.</li>
<ul>
<li>The default value of the <code>cache.h22.recover.if.restarted.in.milliseconds</code> has been changed to <code>0</code>, to prevent a restarted server from attempting to recover a bad cache.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Please perform a fresh installation of dotCMS 5.2.6 to a new location to have the new starter site installed for you.</li>
<li>Once the new starter site is installed, you can use <a href="/docs/latest/bundles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bundles</a> to copy features from the new starter site to your existing site.</li>
</ul>
<li>Improved the "Add to Bundle" functionality to remember the last Bundle name selected (<a href="https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/14066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#14066</a>)</li>
<ul>
<li></li>

<li>Added a new parameter to the Content REST API to return full Category information in results (<a href="https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/12739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#12739</a>)</li>
<ul>
<li>The <code>includeCategoriesExtraInfo</code> URL parameter can now be supplied (e.g. <code>/includeCategoriesExtraInfo/true</code>) to reutrn full Category information in the results.</li>
</ul>
<li>Added the ability to create "pluggable" content field validations using OSGI plugins (<a href="https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/17773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#17773</a>)</li>
<ul>
<li>This allows you to add your own custom code to perform sophisticated and proprietary validations on the data users enter into your content fields.</li>
</ul>
<li>Improved the Binary field to allow limiting of both file length and file type in all uploaded files (<a href="https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/17772" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#17772</a>)</li>
<ul>
<li>You may use the <code>allowedFileTypes</code> Field Variable to specify which mime types may be uploaded, and the <code>maxFileLength</code> Field Variable to limit the size of all uploads.</li>
<li>Since these limitations are implemented as Field Variables, you may set different limits for different Binary fields, even within the same content type (to ensure, for example, that one Binary field is used to upload only videos, while another is used to upload only photos).</li>

<ul>
<li>Improved the REST API to allow Binary fields to be uploaded by specifying a remote URL (<a href="https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/16852" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#16852</a>)</li>
<ul>
<li>Previously, files needed to be uploaded to dotCMS prior to adding them to Binary fields.</li>
</ul>
<li>Simplified the <a href="/docs/latest/image-resizing-and-processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Processing REST API</a> to eliminate the need to explicitly specify which filters are used and in what order.</li>
<ul>
<li>You may now simply supply the appropriate filter parameters, and the filter operations will be performed in the order the parameters appear.</li>
<li>You may also continue to explicitly specify the filters and the filter order (as in older versions), so older image URLs do not need to be modified in any way.</li>
<li>For more information, please sse the <a href="/docs/latest/image-resizing-and-processing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Image Resizing &amp; Processing documentation</a>.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Permissions required to create new Content Types has <i>increased</i></b>.</li>
<ul>
<li>The authority level required to create new Content Types has been increased from EDIT to PUBLISH (<a href="https://github.com/dotCMS/core/issues/15285" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#15285</a>)</li>

</ul>
</ul>
<h3 id="NewFeatures5.1.0">New Features</h3>
<p>In addition to the <a href="#ImportantChanges5.1.0">Important Changes</a> listed above, the following additional new features have been added in dotCMS 5.1.0:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>New Relationships Fields</b></li>
<ul>
<li>A new type of Relationship field has been added, offering significant improvements over the legacy Relationships from older versions.</li>
<li>You may now create Relationships by adding Relationships to Content Types as fields which are created and displayed separately for each side of the Relationship.</li>
<li>This change provides more flexibility in the types of Relationships you can create, allowing you to now create both One-to-One Relationships and Relationships which are visible from only one side of the Relationship.</li>
<li>These new Relationships also allow you to access related content directly via Lucene and Elasticsearch queries, treating related content as a field of the content, rather than requiring dedicated methods (such as <code>$dotcontent.PullRelated()</code>) to retrieve related content.</li>
<li>Using the new Relationship fields, you may also now search for related content from the Content Search screen.</li>
<li>Legacy Relationships and Legacy Relationships fields are both still supported for backward compatibility.</li>
<ul>
<li>You may mix new Relationships fields and Legacy Relationships fields in the same Content Type.</li>
<li>You can choose to convert Legacy Relationships to new Relationships fields, but to ensure backward compatibility, conversion will not be done automatically.</li>
<li>A "Relationships" tab in Content Types will still be displayed if you have Legacy Relationships on a Content Type and have not added a Legacy Relationship field to the Content Type.</li>
<li>However the "Relationships" tab is now built as a regular Tab-Divider field followed by a Legacy Relationships field in the Content Type, and any new Relationship fields will <i>not</i> display in the Legacy Relationships field.</li>
</ul>
<li>For information on how to upgrade your existing Relationships to the new Relationships fields, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/migrating-legacy-relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Migrating Legacy Relationships</a> documentation.</li>
<li>For more information, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/relationships" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relationships documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Containers as Files</b></li>
<ul>
<li>You may now create and manage Containers completely via files.</li>
<li>These files may be managed via WebDAV and other file management operations, easing integration of dotCMS with your CI/CD operations.</li>
<li>As part of this change, some Containers in the dotCMS Starter site were converted to File Containers.</li>
<li>For more information, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/file-based-containers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">File Based Containers documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Custom REST Endpoints</b></li>
<ul>
<li>You may now easily create custom REST endpoints using Velocity files.</li>
<li>All HTTP Methods for RESTful services are supported, including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.</li>
<li>Velocity methods have been added which simplify the generation of output in JSON and XML formats for your custom endpoints.</li>
<li>A /vtl/dynamic REST endpoint has been added which allows you to render output from HTML and Velocity code dynamically.</li>
<li>For more information, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/scripted-custom-endpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scripted Custom Endpoints documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>GraphQL REST API</b></li>
<ul>
<li>A REST API has been added that supports the <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphQL</a> dynamic query language for retrieving content.</li>
<li>GraphQL allows you to selectively retrieve and arrange the content and fields you retrieve, enabling you to reduce the size of responses and insulate your applications from future changes to your dotCMS content and Content Types.</li>
<li>For more information, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/graphql" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GraphQL documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Field Variables for Content Type Fields</b></li>
<ul>
<li>You may now add "Field Variables" to fields in your Content Types.</li>
<li>These Field Variables can be used to distinguish and handle fields of the same field type differently, either within the same Content Type or among different Content Types.</li>
<li>The Field Variables for a Content Type field may be accessed from both Velocity code and Plugins.</li>
<li>These field variables are now used to allow customization of the WYSIWYG field, and are intended to be expanded to allow customization of other Content Type fields in the future.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>WYSIWYG Field Customization on a per-Content Type and per-Field Basis</b></li>
<ul>
<li>You may use the new Field Variables feature to specify tinyMCE customizations for each WYSIWYG field individually by specifyin a Field Variable named <code>tinyMCEProps</code>, which will be used to initialize the WYSIWYG field editor.</li>
<li>For more information, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/the-wysiwyg-field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WYSIWYG Field documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<li>CORS Header Configuration</li>
<ul>
<li>You can now configure headers to send with CORS requests.</li>
<li>Headers can be configured as global defaults, and can be overridden for specific endpoints.</li>
<li>For more information, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/cors-header-configuration">CORS Header Configuration</a> documentation.</li>
</ul>
<!--
    <li><b>Content Version REST API</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>A new REST API has been added which allows you to pull all versions of content, not just the working and live versions.</li>
        <li>For more information, please see the <a href="/docs/latest/content-version-rest-api">Content Version REST API documentation</a>.</li>

                        <p id="Release5.0.3">dotCMS 5.0.3 is a maintenance release to fix several issues which affected some customers with the dotCMS 5.0.2 release.</p>
<p>It is recommended that all customers running the 5.0.0, 5.0.1, or 5.0.2 releases upgrade to dotCMS 5.0.3 as soon as possible.</p>
<!--<h3 id="ImportantChanges5.0.3"><b>Important Changes</b></h3>
<p>Some changes in dotCMS 5.0.3 configuration may impact your performance when upgrading an existing site.  Please read the documentation sections on all of these changes before upgrading from a previous release.</p>

<h4 id="">Device Type Preview Permissions</h4>
<p>In prior versions, all users could see all devices in the Page preview mode.  To enable the preview of different Device Type content on different dotCMS Sites, the Page preview mode now requires appropriate permissions to preview a Device Type on a page.  If the desired behavior is that all backend users should be able to view all device types (as in previous versions), then you may do one of the following to restore that behavior:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Choose a System Role that every validated user has (such as the <a href="/docs/latest/loggedin-site-user" target="_blank">LoggedIn Site User</a> Role), and give it View permission to the *Device Type* Content Type</li>
    <li>Create a new Role, assign it to all users, and give it View permission to the *Device Type* Content Type.
</ul>
