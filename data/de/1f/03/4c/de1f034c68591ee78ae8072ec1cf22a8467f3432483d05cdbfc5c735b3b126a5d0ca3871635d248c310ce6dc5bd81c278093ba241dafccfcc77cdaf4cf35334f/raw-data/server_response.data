<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-windows-http-services-could-allow-remote-code-execution-960803">Vulnerabilities in Windows HTTP Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution (960803)</h2>
<p>Published: April 14, 2009 | Updated: April 29, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP). The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by changing the way that Windows HTTP Services handles errors and validates certificates, and by ensuring that Windows HTTP Services correctly use NTLM credential reflection protection mechanisms. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/960803" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 960803</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?</strong><br/>
Yes, in order to resolve the issue described in CVE-2009-0089, Microsoft has implemented a new registry key UseFQDNFallbackForCnCompare under SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WinHttp, which controls the behavior of WinHTTP when validating the fully qualified domain name of a host against a certificate's distinguished name entry.</p>
<p>By default, this registry key does not exist, which ensures WinHTTP fully validates that the distinguished name (DN) contained in the certificate is identical to the DN to which the connection was initiated. The old behavior can be re-enabled by setting this registry key to True. In this case, validation will be less strict and will accept if the certificate matches a name change through forwarding at the DNS level. This is the less secure behavior which is default prior to the installation of this security update.</p>

#### FAQ for Windows HTTP Services Integer Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0086
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with the same user rights as the service or application which calls the WinHTTP API to connect to the attacker's Web server.
  
This vulnerability affects Windows components and third-party applications that use Windows HTTP Services and are configured to connect to remote, untrusted Web servers.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
The vulnerability is caused by lack of validation of a parameter returned by a remote Web server. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
  
**What is Windows HTTP Services?**   
Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to Web servers. WinHTTP can be used by both Microsoft Windows components and third-party software. WinHTTP is, amongst others, used by the Universal Plug and Play (UPNP) Service.
  
**What is Universal Plug and Play?**   
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) is a capability that allows devices on a network to discover other devices and determine how to work with them. UPnP is most easily understood by comparison to plug-and-play (PnP) capability that most Windows users already are familiar with. PnP allows the operating system to detect new hardware when you install it on a system. For instance, when you install a new mouse onto your computer, PnP allows Windows to detect it, load the needed drivers, and begin using it. UPnP extends this concept to devices on a network, rather than on the local system itself. UPnP lets computers learn about other devices on the network, and determine how to use them. For instance, a computer could use UPnP to detect whether there are printers on the network that it can use and learn how to use them.
  
**What is the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP)?**   
Device discovery is the process through which UPnP-capable computers become aware of the availability of devices they can use, and learn how to request services from them. When a UPnP-capable computer boots, there may already be devices on the network that it can use. To determine whether this is the case, the computer sends a broadcast request (called an M-SEARCH directive), asking that any UPnP-capable device within the subnet respond directly to it and provide information about using it.
  
Similarly, when a device that supports UPnP (for instance, a UPnP-capable printer) boots, there may already be UPnP-capable computers on the network that would like to use it. The device broadcasts a message (called a NOTIFY directive) to all computers within the subnet, announcing its presence on the network and inviting computers to make use of its services.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the service or application which calls the WinHTTP API to connect to the attacker's Web server. Applications running under accounts that are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than applications running under accounts with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
An attacker would need to force or entice a program using Windows HTTP Services to connect to his malicious Web server. It is important to note that the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service uses the WinHTTP libraries. When this service is enabled, malicious users on the local subnet may respond to SSDP requests and lead the UPnP service to connect using WinHTTP to a malicious host that could then exploit this vulnerability. The UPNP service runs under the LocalService account, which is an account with limited privileges on the system.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Windows HTTP Services handles the error resulting in the exploitable condition.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
  
Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0089  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
A spoofing vulnerability exists in Windows HTTP Services as a result of the incomplete validation of the distinguished name in a digital certificate. When combined with specific other attacks, such as DNS spoofing, this may allow an attacker to successfully spoof the digital certificate of a Web site for any application that uses Windows HTTP Services.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0089](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0089).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0089
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   All supported editions of Internet Explorer are not affected by this vulnerability because Windows HTTP Services is not used by the software.

#### FAQ for Windows HTTP Services Certificate Name Mismatch Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0089
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a spoofing vulnerability that exists in Windows HTTP Services. When combined with specific other attacks, such as DNS spoofing, this may allow an attacker to successfully spoof the digital certificate of a Web site for any application that uses Windows HTTP Services.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
When an application calls into Windows HTTP Services to set up a connection to a remote Web server, WinHTTP only validates the fully qualified domain name of the URL against the certificate of the original Web site to which the host attempted connect to. Specific combinations of DNS spoofing may forward a connection to a different Web server that has a valid certificate for that specific host, but not for the web page to which WinHTTP initiated the connection. The combination of DNS spoofing and this vulnerability could lead to WinHTTP incorrectly considering the certificate for the remote Web server as acceptable. As WinHTTP depends on the application for user interaction, the user might not be warned of this discrepancy by the application.
  
**What is Windows HTTP Services?**   
Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to other HTTP servers.
  
**What are digital certificates?**   
The digital certificate is a common credential that's used to authenticate identity. A trusted organization assigns a certificate to an individual or an entity, the subject of that certificate. The trusted organization that issues the certificate is a Certification Authority (CA) and is known as the certificate's issuer. A trustworthy CA will issue a certificate only after verifying the identity of the certificate's subject.
  
**What is DNS spoofing?**   
Domain Name System (DNS) is one of the industry-standard suite of protocols that comprise TCP/IP. DNS is implemented using two software components: the DNS server and the DNS client (or resolver). Both components are run as background service applications. Network resources are identified by numeric IP addresses, but these IP addresses are difficult for network users to remember. The DNS database contains records that map user-friendly alphanumeric names for network resources to the IP addresses used by those resources for communication. In this way, DNS acts as a mnemonic device, making network resources easier to remember for network users. For more information and to view logical diagrams illustrating how DNS fits with other Windows technologies, review the TechNet article, [What is DNS?](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc787921.aspx)
  
DNS Spoofing is a broad category of attacks in which at one point within the DNS system, incorrect DNS responses are introduced by a third party not normally responsible for those responses. Such an attack may cause a domain or host name to resolve to an IP address to which it was not intended to resolve by the owners of that name. As such, a host may be elicited to connect to a third-party, potentially malicious server.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker could impersonate a secure Web site and offer malicious content to the application using Windows HTTP Services, which would trust it as if it originated from a secure Web site.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
An attacker would need to combine this vulnerability with DNS spoofing or a similar attack in order to direct the outbound connection to a server under his control. He would then offer a certificate valid for the his Web site connected to which would be incorrectly validated by Windows HTTP Services as valid for the destination host Web site to which the user originally tried to connect.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The update removes the vulnerability by changing the way Windows HTTP Services validates certificates belonging to a secure Web site.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.
  
Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Windows HTTP Services handles NTLM credentials when a user connects to an attacker's Web server. This vulnerability allows an attacker to replay the user's credentials back to the attacker and execute code in the context of the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2009-0550](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0550).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   All supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 by default have the profile for the Windows firewall set to public, which reduces exposure on these platforms to this vulnerability because, under public profile, the firewall blocks SMB traffic. Since the client would need to be running a service which accepts NTLM authentication in order for the attack to be successful and the credentials reflected, the most common attack vector would be SMB.
  
#### Workarounds for Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550
  
Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.
  
#### FAQ for Windows HTTP Services Credential Reflection Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0550
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
In addition, this issue also affects Internet Explorer and the Windows Internet API. Microsoft recommends that users of Internet Explorer install the security update provided by [MS09-014](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027).
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**   
Windows HTTP Services does not correctly opt-in to NTLM credential-reflection protections to ensure that a user's credentials are not reflected back and used against the user.
  
**What is Microsoft Windows HTTP Services?**   
Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP) provides developers with an HTTP client application programming interface (API) to send requests through the HTTP protocol to other HTTP servers.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**   
An attacker could gain the rights of the logged-on user and do anything that the logged-on user has privileges to do. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
This vulnerability requires that a user with an affected version of Windows HTTP Services accesses a malicious server. An attacker would have to host a specially crafted Web server which captures the user's NTLM log on credentials. The attacker then replays those credentials to a service on the user's client that accepts NTLM authentication. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted server. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**   
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**What does the update do?**   
The security update remediates the vulnerability by ensuring that Windows HTTP Services opts appropriately into credential protection mechanisms available from Windows.
  
**Why is this vulnerability and the WinINet Credential Reflection Vulnerability assigned the same CVE number (CVE-2009-0550) in MS09-014, Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027)?**   
CVE-2009-0550 affects both WinINet, as used by Internet Explorer, and Windows HTTP Services, a component of the Windows operating system. Microsoft recommends that users of Internet Explorer also install the security update provided by [MS09-014](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=146659), Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (963027).
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**   
Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2009-0550](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0550).
  
**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**   
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**
  
Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang=en).
  
The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).
  
For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951)Web site.
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
