			<p><p>You can now securely share virtually any 1Password item with anyone – even if they don't use 1Password! 🎉</p>
<p>To get started, open the share menu and select "Share" to generate a link, specify who you want to share the item with and for how long, then send out the link however you wish. It's as simple as copy and paste, without the security risks that come from pasting sensitive info directly into chat and email. 😱</p>
<p>Use it to send logins to an external contractor, share the Wi-Fi password with your visiting in-laws, or pass a Secure Note to your partner.</p>
<p>Happy sharing! 🥳🎊</p>

			<p><p>Now that Android 11 has officially arrived, we've updated 1Password to embrace the best of Google's newest release! Autofill your Logins from the Gboard suggestion strip in supported apps and browsers. Fine tune which files 1Password has access to when setting up local storage sync. And keep work and play separate with improved support for work profiles.</p>
<h2>May we suggest Autofill?</h2>
<p>The keyboard suggestion strip is a conveniently located place to offer helpful access to things like the clipboard and emoji. Android 11 and Gboard take it a step further by including support for displaying Autofill results in the suggestion strip as well. When using Autofill with 1Password in supported apps and browsers, your Login items will now be displayed above the keyboard instead of in a dropdown menu, keeping the rest of your screen free of clutter.</p>
<h2>File it under privacy</h2>
<p>Android 11 includes more granular control over which files an app can access and gives you the ability to revoke that access at any time. 1Password now supports these enhanced protections by making use of the system file picker both when setting up local storage sync and when restoring access later.</p>
<h2>Ready for work and play</h2>
<p>In addition to the improvements specific to Android 11, we've also added support for allowing your workplace administrator to configure security settings for 1Password in your work profile. Your administrator can now set requirements for biometrics, PIN code, and Master Password timeout according to your workplace policies.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy this release and look forward to your feedback on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agilebits.onepassword">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/1Password">Twitter</a>, and in the <a href="https://discussions.agilebits.com/categories/1password-android">1Password forums</a>!</p>

			<p><p>In this update, we’ve added the ability to view vault details from the vault switcher and resolved a few bugs that snuck into the last beta. We’ve fixed an issue where the lock on exit preference was ignored when the 1Password accessibility service was enabled. We’ve also resolved a bug where 1Password jumped to the foreground any time it locked while running in the background.

			<p><p>1Password has learned a few new moves in this latest edition! You can now send your family or team members a link that will open directly to that shared item. Beautify your notes using Markdown formatting to keep them legible and organized. Sort your items by name, date, title and more to quickly find what you are looking for.</p>
<h2>Share links to items</h2>
<p>Point family or team members in the right direction with a link to an item that you've shared with them. Instead of sending them searching for items by name and vault, you can simply send them a link that will open the item with a single tap. No more looking for that needle in the haystack!</p>
<h2>Style notes with Markdown</h2>
<p>Easily style your notes to include headings, lists, and text formatting using Markdown. From adding a short note in one of your Login items to drafting your next blog post in a Secure Note, Markdown formatting is here to help keep things legible and tidy.</p>
<h2>Sort items in any list</h2>
<p>Whether you're searching or browsing, viewing all your items or just the ones in a specific category, you can now sort your items by name, date, type and more. Sort by date modified when you want to track down those items you've recently created or the ones you haven't updated in a while. Choose password strength when it's time to find the weakest links in your security chain and make them stronger.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy these latest additions as much as we enjoyed building them for you!

			<p><p>We’re delivering a blend of features in this update that enhance both ease of use and security. You can now create new vaults to organize your items while on the go. When signing into websites and apps, you can preview the Logins available for autofill. And you can use your security key as a second factor when signing in to your 1Password account.</p>
<h2>Build it up</h2>
<p>Having multiple vaults helps you to keep everything in its right place. That's easier than ever now that you can create a new vault while on the go! With a few taps in the vault menu, you can create a brand new vault with its own custom icon, ready to securely store your latest secrets.</p>
<h2>See the sites</h2>
<p>Signing into websites and apps is even easier now that you can see which Logins are available to autofill without first having to unlock 1Password. After selecting the Login, you'll be prompted to unlock 1Password if needed before the Login is autofilled for you. Turn on Autofill previews in Settings > Autofill to start enjoying this feature now!</p>
<h2>Lock it down</h2>
<p>You can now protect your 1Password account with an additional layer of security. After enabling two-factor authentication on 1Password.com and adding a hardware security key to your account, you will prompted to provide your security key whenever you sign in to your account on an Android device.</p>
<p>We hope you love this update as much as we've loved building it for you!

			<p><p>To help kick off the second half of August, we have an exciting set of changes in this beta release.

			<p><p>We hope that you've been enjoying the more versatile wardrobe that 1Password adopted in version 7.2! With that in mind, we're returning to Dark Theme in this update to make some further improvements. In addition to fixing some minor issues with theming, 1Password now automatically switches themes on Android Pie devices that also have a system-level Theme setting. We've also updated our sign-up flow to incorporate the latest improvements from Google Play. Looking forward to your feedback!</p>

			<p><p>We've enhanced your 1Password experience with a great set of new features in this update. With baked-in support for Dark Theme, a more convenient way to create new Login items as you need them, and full control over your trashed items, you may have trouble picking your one favourite new thing!</p>
<h2>Paint it black</h2>
<p>Whether you're seeking to reduce the drain on your battery or the strain on your eyes, you can now embrace the darker side of 1Password with our newly styled Dark Theme. By default, 1Password will automatically switch to Dark Theme when you choose it in your system settings or battery saver is enabled. Or if you prefer, you can manually select the theme of your choice from the display settings in 1Password.</p>
<h2>Create on the fly</h2>
<p>When using Autofill with 1Password, you can now create new Login items for apps and websites without having to first return to the main app. Easily get credentials out of your head and into 1Password for your existing accounts. And when it comes to creating credentials for new accounts, you can use the built-in Strong Password Generator to ensure that those accounts stay secure.</p>
<h2>Take out the trash</h2>
<p>You can manage your trashed items on your Android device with the new Trashed category in 1Password. Upon reviewing your trashed items, you can restore any items that you may have accidentally moved to the trash. You can then empty the trash to delete any items that you no longer need, allowing you to keep your vaults tidy and clutter free.</p>
<p>We hope you love this update as much as we've loved building it for you! We look forward to your feedback on Google Play, Twitter, and in the 1Password Forums.</p>

			<p><p>Whether you're just getting started with 1Password or you're a seasoned pro, we've got a fantastic set of improvements for you in this update! From kicking off your 1Password membership with a Google Play subscription, to creating and storing your Emergency Kit, to organizing things your way with tags, we've got you covered.</p>
<h2>Start off on the right foot</h2>
<p>It's now easier than ever to get started with a 1Password membership. You don't need to go find your credit card or even switch away from 1Password. Built-in support for Google Play subscriptions means that you can manage billing for your 1Password membership using your Google account.</p>
<h2>Be ready for anything</h2>
<p>You don't want to think about your phone getting lost, damaged, or stolen. But you do want to protect your data in case that does happen. You can now create your Emergency Kit in 1Password and save it to your personal cloud storage to ensure you never lose access to your 1Password account.</p>
<h2>Organize all the things</h2>
<p>With everything that you've got stored in 1Password, you may find yourself in need of a little organization. Well now you can organize your items with tags in 1Password for Android. Better yet, you can even nest those tags for the ultimate in organizational nirvana.</p>
<p>We hope you love this update as much as we've loved building it for you! We look forward to your feedback on Google Play, Twitter, and in the 1Password Forums.</p>

			<p><p>We've got a fantastic beta for you this week, jam-packed with new features for you to enjoy. The first thing you'll notice is the shiny new lock screen standing guard over your data. If you're a fan of either DuckDuckGo or Brave, you'll soon discover that 1Password now supports filling in both of those browsers as well. We've also made it easier to drop that old Primary vault once you've made the switch to a 1Password membership. Looking forward to your feedback on these changes and more!</p>
</p>

			
				<h4 class="new change">New</h4>
				<ul>
				
					<li> Launch 1Password to a newly redesigned lock screen complete with beautiful animations. {1}

			<p><p>While we're eagerly awaiting the arrival of summer, we've been working on some more great improvements in 1Password. We've added the ability to favourite or delete multiple items at once, making it even easier to manage the contents of your vaults. In addition to those new actions, we've also updated the spacing and alignment of item lists to make them easier to scan, added a splash of new paint to the favourite badge, and fixed a couple of quirky errors. We hope you enjoy!</p>

Go ahead and do a reinstall... you know you want to try it out!</p>

We're also working hard on improvements in 1Password and in this update, we've focused our attention on a better Autofill experience when using the 1Password Accessibility service.

In addition to fixing an issue that could prevent your Autofill matches from displaying, we've also added the ability to manually dismiss the "Autofill with 1Password" prompt when using the 1Password Accessibility service.

			<p>We've been quiet on the beta front for a little while, but that doesn't mean that things have been quiet for the Android team at AgileBits. As you may have heard, our preliminary implementation of fingerprint unlock support for Android M was demoed at Google I/O last week. While we’re not quite ready to beta test fingerprint unlock, we’ve got something equally exciting for you today: Wi-Fi Sync! When you first set up 1Password, you can now choose between local storage, Dropbox, or Wi-Fi sync to sync your primary vault between your Mac or Windows PC and your Android device.
</p>
