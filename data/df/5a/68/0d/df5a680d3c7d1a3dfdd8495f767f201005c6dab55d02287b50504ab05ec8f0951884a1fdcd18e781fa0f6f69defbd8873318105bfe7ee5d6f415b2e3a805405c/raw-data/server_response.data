<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-windows-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-959454">Vulnerabilities in Windows Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (959454)</h2>
<p>Published: April 14, 2009 | Updated: April 29, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.0</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves four publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker is allowed to log on to the system and then run a specially crafted application. The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine in order to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control over the affected system.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the way that Microsoft Windows addresses tokens requested by the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC), and by properly isolating WMI providers and processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p>This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/951306" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 951306</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959454" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 959454</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>

Windows MSDTC Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1436  
-------------------------------------------------------------
  
An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) transaction facility in Microsoft Windows platforms. MSDTC leaves a NetworkService token that can be impersonated by any process that calls into it. The vulnerability allows a process that is not running under the NetworkService account, but that has the SeImpersonatePrivilege, to elevate its privilege to NetworkService and execute code with NetworkService privileges. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1436](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-1436).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Windows MSDTC Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1436
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The attacker must be able to run code on the local machine to exploit this vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-windows-msdtc-service-isolation-vulnerability---cve-2008-1436">Workarounds for Windows MSDTC Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1436</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>IIS 6.0 - Configure a Worker Process Identity (WPI) for an application pool in IIS to use a created account in IIS Manager and disable MSDTC</strong></p>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In IIS Manager, expand the local computer, expand <strong>Application Pools</strong>, right-click the application pool and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Identity</strong> tab and click <strong>Configurable</strong>. In the <strong>User name</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> boxes, type the user name and password of the account under which you want the worker process to operate.</li>
<li>Add the chosen user account to the IIS_WPG group.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disabling the Distributed Transaction Coordinator will help protect the affected system from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. To disable the Distributed Transaction Coordinator, perform these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. Alternatively, point to <strong>Settings</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li>
<li>Double-click <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>. Alternatively, click <strong>Switch to Classic View</strong> and then double-click <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>.</li>
<li>Double-click <strong>Services</strong>.</li>
<li>Double-click <strong>Distributed Transaction Coordinator</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Startup</strong> type list, click <strong>Disabled</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Stop</strong> (if started), and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also stop and disable the MSDTC service by using the following command at the command prompt:<br/>
sc stop MSDTC &amp; sc config MSDTC start= disabled</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Managing the additional user accounts created in this workaround results in increased administrative overhead. Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application functionality may be affected. An example is Windows Authentication; see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/871179" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 871179</a>. Disabling MSDTC will prevent applications from using distributed transactions. Disabling MSDTC will prevent IIS 5.1 from running in Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, and IIS 6.0 running in IIS 5.0 compatibility mode. Disabling MSDTC will prevent configuration as well as running of COM+ applications.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IIS 7.0 - Specify a WPI for an application pool in IIS Manager</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In IIS Manager, expand the server node, click <strong>Application Pools</strong>, right-click the application pool, and then click <strong>Advanced Settings…</strong></li>
<li>Find the <strong>Identity</strong> entry, and click the <strong>…</strong> button to open the <strong>Application Pool Identity</strong> dialog box.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Custom account</strong> option and click <strong>Set</strong> to open the <strong>Set Credentials</strong> dialog box. Type in the selected <strong>Account name</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> in the user name and password text boxes. Retype the Password in the <strong>Confirm password</strong> text box, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Application pool identities are dynamically added to IIS_WPG group in IIS7 and don’t need to be manually added.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Managing the additional user accounts created in this workaround results in increased administrative overhead. Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application functionality may be affected.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>IIS 7.0 - Specify a WPI for an application pool using the Command Line utility, APPCMD.exe</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>From an elevated command prompt, change to the %systemroot%\system32\inetsrv directory.</li>
<li>Execute the APPCMD.exe command using the following syntax where <em>string</em> is the name of the application pool; userName:<em>string</em> is the user name of the account assigned to the application pool; and password:<em>string</em> is the password for the account.<br/>
appcmd set config /section:applicationPools /<br/>
[name='string'].processModel.identityType:SpecificUser /<br/>
[name='string'].processModel.userName:string /<br/>
[name='string'].processModel.password:string</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Application pool identities are dynamically added to IIS_WPG group in IIS 7.0 and do not need to be manually added.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Managing the additional user accounts created in this workaround results in increased administrative overhead. Depending on the nature of applications running in this application pool, application functionality may be affected.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="faq-for-windows-msdtc-service-isolation-vulnerability---cve-2008-1436">FAQ for Windows MSDTC Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1436</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with NetworkService privileges. An attacker could then obtain the LocalSystem token from other vulnerable services and install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
The vulnerability is due to the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) transaction facility allowing the NetworkService token to be obtained and used when making an RPC call.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator?</strong> <br/>
The Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) is a distributed transaction facility for Microsoft Windows platforms. MSDTC uses proven transaction processing technology. It is robust despite system failures, process failures, and communication failures; it exploits loosely coupled systems to provide scalable performance; and it is easy to install, configure, and manage.</p>
<p>For more information about MSDTC, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679938.aspx" data-linktype="external">DTC Developers Guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is RPC?</strong> <br/>
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that a program can use to request a service from a program located on another computer in a network. RPC helps with interoperability because the program using RPC does not have to understand the network protocols that are supporting communication. In RPC, the requesting program is the client and the service-providing program is the server.</p>
<p><strong>What is the NetworkService Account?</strong> <br/>
The NetworkService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and acts as the computer on the network. A service that runs in the context of the NetworkService account presents the computer's credentials to remote servers. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684272(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">NetworkService Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the LocalService Account?</strong> <br/>
The LocalService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. For information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684188(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">LocalService Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the LocalSystem Account?</strong> <br/>
The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs; these accounts have access to most system objects. A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the Service Control Manager. Most services do not need such a high privilege level. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684190.aspx" data-linktype="external">LocalSystem Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How is IIS affected by this issue?</strong> <br/>
Systems running user-provided code in Internet Information Services (IIS) may be affected. For example ISAPI filters and extensions, and ASP.NET code running in full trust may be affected by this vulnerability.</p>
<p>IIS is not affected in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Installations of IIS 5.1, IIS 6.0, and IIS 7.0</li>
<li>ASP.NET configured to run with a trust level lower than Full Trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is SQL Server affected by this issue?</strong> <br/>
Systems running SQL Server may be affected if a user is granted administrative privileges to load and run code. A user with SQL Server administrator privileges could execute specially crafted code that could leverage the attack. However, this privilege is not granted by default.</p>
<p><strong>What additional applications may be affected by this vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
Systems running any process with SeImpersonatePrivilege that loads and runs user-provided code may be susceptible to an elevation of privilege attack as described in this security bulletin. The SeImpersonatePrivilege setting is described in Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 821546.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong> <br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run specially crafted code in the context of the NetworkService account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p>All systems running all supported editions of Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2 and Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, and all supported versions and editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 may be at risk if IIS is enabled or SQL Server is installed and configured or deployed in a vulnerable state as described in this bulletin.</p>
<p>In addition, IIS systems that allow users to upload code are at increased risk. SQL Server systems are at risk if untrusted users are granted privileged account access. This may include Web hosting providers or similar environments.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong> <br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by reducing the privilege level on the token requested by MSDTC.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong> <br/>
Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CVE-2008-1436.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong> <br/>
Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code, published publicly, that attempts to exploit this vulnerability?</strong> <br/>

<h4 id="faq-for-windows-wmi-service-isolation-vulnerability---cve-2009-0078">FAQ for Windows WMI Service Isolation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0078</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the LocalSystem account. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
The vulnerability is due to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provider improperly isolating processes that run under the NetworkService or LocalService accounts. Two separate processes running under same account have full access to each other’s resources such as file handle, registry keys, handles,and so on. The WMI provider host process holds SYSTEM Tokens in certain scenarios. If an attacker gains access to a computer under the context of a NetworkService or LocalService account, the attacker can execute code to probe the WMI provider host processes for SYSTEM tokens. Once a SYSTEM token is found, the attacker's code can use it to gain SYSTEM level privileges.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)?</strong> <br/>
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the primary management technology for Microsoft Windows operating systems. It enables consistent and uniform management, control, and monitoring of systems throughout your enterprise. WMI allows system administrators to query, change, and monitor configuration settings on desktop and server systems, applications, networks, and other enterprise components. For more information, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/guide/sas_wmi_overview.mspx?mfr=true" data-linktype="external">WMI Scripting Primer</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the NetworkService Account?</strong> <br/>
The NetworkService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and acts as the computer on the network. A service that runs in the context of the NetworkService account presents the computer's credentials to remote servers. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684272(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">Network Service Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the LocalService Account?</strong> <br/>
The LocalService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. For information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684188(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">LocalService Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the LocalSystem Account?</strong> <br/>
The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs; these accounts have access to most system objects. A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms685150(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">Service Control Manager</a>. Most services do not need such a high privilege level. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684190.aspx" data-linktype="external">LocalSystem Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How is IIS affected by this issue?</strong> <br/>
Systems running user-provided code in Internet Information Services (IIS) may be affected. For example ISAPI filters and extensions, and ASP.NET code running in full trust may be affected by this vulnerability.</p>
<p>IIS is not affected in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Installations of IIS 5.1, IIS 6.0, and IIS 7.0</li>
<li>ASP.NET configured to run with a trust level lower than Full Trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is SQL Server affected by this issue?</strong> <br/>
Systems running SQL Server may be affected if a user is granted administrative privileges to load and run code. A user with SQL Server administrator privileges could execute specially crafted code that could leverage the attack. However, this privilege is not granted by default.</p>
<p><strong>Which WMI providers are impacted by this update?</strong><br/>
A complete list of WMI providers impacted by this can update can be found in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956572" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 956572</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What additional applications may be affected by this vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
Systems running any process with SeImpersonatePrivilege that loads and runs user-provided code may be susceptible to an elevation of privilege attack as described in this security bulletin. The SeImpersonatePrivilege setting is described in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/821546" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 821546</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong> <br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run specially crafted code in the context of the NetworkService or LocalService accounts that could gain access to resources in processes that are also running as NetworkService or LocalService. Some of these processes may have the ability to elevate their privileges to LocalSystem, allowing any NetworkService or LocalService processes to elevate their privileges to LocalSystem as well. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to convince a logged-on user to execute code on their system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p>All systems running all supported editions of Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3, and all supported versions and editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008 may be at risk if IIS is enabled or SQL Server is installed and configured or deployed in a vulnerable state as described by this bulletin.</p>
<p>In addition, IIS systems that allow users to upload code are at increased risk. SQL Server systems are at risk if untrusted users are granted privileged account access. This may include Web hosting providers or similar environments.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong> <br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by properly isolating WMI providers to ensure they are invoked in a secure manner.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong> <br/>

<h4 id="faq-for-windows-thread-pool-acl-weakness-vulnerability---cve-2009-0080">FAQ for Windows Thread Pool ACL Weakness Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0080</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code with LocalSystem privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
The vulnerability is due to Windows placing incorrect access control lists (ACLs) on threads in the current ThreadPool.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Windows ThreadPool Class?</strong> <br/>
The Windows ThreadPool class provides a pool of threads that can be used to post work items, process asynchronous I/O, wait on behalf of other threads, and process timers. Many applications create threads that spend a great deal of time in the sleeping state, waiting for an event to occur. Other threads might enter a sleeping state only to be awakened periodically to poll for a change or update status information. Thread pooling enables you to use threads more efficiently by providing your application with a pool of worker threads that are managed by the system. One thread monitors the status of several wait operations queued to the thread pool. When a wait operation completes, a worker thread from the thread pool executes the corresponding callback function. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.threadpool.aspx" data-linktype="external">ThreadPool Class</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is an Access Control List (ACL)?</strong> <br/>
An access control list (ACL) is a list of security protections that applies to an object. An object can be a file, process, event, or anything else having a security descriptor. An entry in an ACL is an access control entry (ACE). There are two types of access control list, discretionary and system. Each ACE in an ACL identifies access rights allowed, denied, or audited for that trustee. For information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa374872(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">Access Control Lists</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the NetworkService Account?</strong> <br/>
The NetworkService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and acts as the computer on the network. A service that runs in the context of the NetworkService account presents the computer's credentials to remote servers. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684272(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">Network Service Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the LocalService Account?</strong> <br/>
The LocalService account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has minimum privileges on the local computer and presents anonymous credentials on the network. For information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684188(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">LocalService Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the LocalSystem Account?</strong> <br/>
The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager. It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs; these accounts have access to most system objects. A service that runs in the context of the LocalSystem account inherits the security context of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms685150(vs.85).aspx" data-linktype="external">Service Control Manager</a>. Most services do not need such a high privilege level. For more information, see the MSDN article, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684190.aspx" data-linktype="external">LocalSystem Account</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How is IIS affected by this issue?</strong> <br/>
Systems running user-provided code in Internet Information Services (IIS) may be affected. For example ISAPI filters and extensions, and ASP.NET code running in full trust may be affected by this vulnerability.</p>
<p>IIS is not affected in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default Installations of IIS 5.1, IIS 6.0, and IIS 7.0</li>
<li>ASP.NET configured to run with a trust level lower than Full Trust</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is SQL Server affected by this issue?</strong> <br/>
Systems running SQL Server may be affected if a user is granted administrative privileges to load and run code. A user with SQL Server administrator privileges could execute specially crafted code that could leverage the attack. However, this privilege is not granted by default.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong> <br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run specially crafted code in the context of the NetworkService or LocalService accounts that could gain access to resources in processes that are also running as NetworkService or LocalService. Some of these processes may have the ability to elevate their privileges to LocalSystem, allowing any NetworkService or LocalService processes to elevate their privileges to LocalSystem as well. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong> <br/>
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who do not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p>All systems running all supported editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 may be at risk if IIS is enabled or SQL Server is installed and configured or deployed in a vulnerable state as described by this bulletin.</p>
<p>In addition, IIS systems that allow users to upload code are at increased risk. SQL Server systems are at risk if untrusted users are granted privileged account access. This may include Web hosting providers or similar environments.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong> <br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability correcting the ACLs on thread within the Thread Pool.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong> <br/>
Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0080" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-0080</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong> <br/>
Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch            | Description                                                                                                                                |  
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches.                                                                                                       |  
| **/quiet**        | Suppresses the display of status or error messages.                                                                                        |  
| **/norestart**    | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |
  
**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 934307](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/934307).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**  
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in **Start Search**.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click on the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  Under the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You may also click on the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you may also click on the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
