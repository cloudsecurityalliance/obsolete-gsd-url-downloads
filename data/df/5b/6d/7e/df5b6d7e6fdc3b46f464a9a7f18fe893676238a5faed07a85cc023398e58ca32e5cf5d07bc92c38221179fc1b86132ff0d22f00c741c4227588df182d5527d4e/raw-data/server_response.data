openssl security and bug fix update (RHSA-2012-0426)<BR>
<BR>
Original Release Date:  May 29, 2012<BR>
Last Revised: September 15, 2015<BR>
Number:  ASA-2012-207<BR>
Risk Level: Low<BR>
Advisory Version:  11.0<BR>
Advisory Status: Final<BR>
<!--DocId: 100162507-->
<hr>
<H2>1. Overview:</H2>
<P>OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.</P>
<P>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed
Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) messages. An attacker
could use this flaw to crash an application that uses OpenSSL to decrypt or
verify S/MIME messages.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name <A HREF=https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2012-1165.html>CVE-2012-1165</A> to this issue.</P>
<P>A flaw was found in the PKCS#7 and Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)
implementations in OpenSSL. An attacker could possibly use this flaw to
perform a Bleichenbacher attack to decrypt an encrypted CMS, PKCS#7, or
S/MIME message by sending a large number of chosen ciphertext messages to
a service using OpenSSL and measuring error response times.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name <A HREF=https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2012-0884.html>CVE-2012-0884</A> to this issue.</P>
<P>More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:</P>

<P><B>Recommended Actions for System Products:</B><BR>Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.</P>

<H3>Mitigating Factors:</H3>
<P>When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
<A HREF="https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674">
Security Vulnerability Classification Policy</A>.
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:</P>
<TABLE BORDER=1>
<TR>
<TH WIDTH=120 ALIGN=left>Vulnerability</TH>
<TH ALIGN=left>Mitigating Factors</TH>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD WIDTH=120>
CVE-2012-0884<br>
CVE-2012-1165
</TD>
<TD>This is a low risk as no critical applications would be impacted or use CMS, PKCS#7,
or S/MIME encrypted messages by default.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<H2>3. Avaya Software-Only Products:</H2>
<P>Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.</P>
<P>In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.</P>
