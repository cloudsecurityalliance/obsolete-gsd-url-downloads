<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-office-web-components-could-allow-remote-code-execution-957638">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Web Components Could Allow Remote Code Execution (957638)</h2>
<p>Published: August 11, 2009 | Updated: October 27, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.0</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Web Components that could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2000 Web Components, Microsoft Office XP Web Components, Microsoft Office 2003 Web Components, Microsoft Office 2003 Web Components for the 2007 Microsoft Office system, Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2004 Standard Edition, Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2004 Enterprise Edition, Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2006, Microsoft BizTalk Server 2002, Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003, and Microsoft Office Small Business Accounting 2006. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correctly handling memory allocation when the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, correcting validation logic for Office Web Components ActiveX control methods, and performing additional parameter validation. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p>This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973472" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 973472</a>. The security updates addressed in this bulletin are not related to the vulnerabilities described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 973882</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/957638" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 957638</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

<p>*Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000 Service Pack 2 is not-affected because the previous OWC release, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=112114" data-linktype="external">MS08-017</a>, set the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">kill bit</a> needed to prevent this exploit.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why was this bulletin rereleased on October 27, 2009?</strong><br/>
Microsoft rereleased this bulletin to reoffer the update for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 and Microsoft Office 2003 Web Components Service Pack 3 to fix a detection issue when Microsoft Office Access Runtime 2003 is installed. This is a detection change only; there were no changes to the binaries. Customers who have successfully updated their systems do not need to reinstall this update.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know which versions of OWC are still in support and which versions of Office they shipped with?</strong><br/>
There are three versions of Office Web Components:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office 2000 Web Components</li>
<li>Office XP Web Components</li>
<li>Office 2003 Web Components</li>
</ul>
<p>Each version was released as a Web download and on the CDs of the corresponding version of Microsoft Office. In addition, each version was re-released together with the next version of Office. Therefore, there is a version of Office 2000 Web Components on the Office XP CDs and a version of Office XP Web Components on the Office 2003 CDs. The Office 2003 Web Components were not released on Office 2007 CDs. However, they were re-released to the Web and included with Microsoft Office Project Server 2007. Although these re-releases carry the same names and functionality as the original release, for technical reasons they are considered separate products for patching purposes.</p>
<p>Each version of OWC, and this includes the re-releases, is supported according to the version of Office with which it shipped. Therefore, the version of Office 2000 Web Components that shipped with Office 2000 was in extended support until Office 2000 left extended support on July 14, 2009. However, the version of Office 2000 Web Components that shipped with Office XP is in extended support until Office XP leaves extended support on July 12, 2011. This same rule applies to the other versions of OWC. The following table lists the support milestone dates and release locations for all the different versions of OWC:</p>

<h2 id="office-web-components-memory-allocation-vulnerability---cve-2009-0562">Office Web Components Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0562</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Office Web Components ActiveX Control. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0562" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-0562</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-office-web-components-memory-allocation-vulnerability---cve-2009-0562">Mitigating Factors for Office Web Components Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0562</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018</a> has been installed.
The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-office-web-components-memory-allocation-vulnerability---cve-2009-0562">Workarounds for Office Web Components Memory Allocation Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0562</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prevent Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>You can prevent the Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys And Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This is the action taken by the ISA Server update package. No binaries are included in this update for ISA Server.</p>
<p>For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Office Web Components, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Office Web Components library from running.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the library objects are contained are documented in the FAQ &quot;What does the update do?&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {0002E543-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} and {0002E55B-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0002E543-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
&quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0002E55B-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
&quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400</li>
</ul>
<p>You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/6d7cb788-b31d-4d17-9f1e-b5ddaa6deecd1033.mspx?mfr=true" data-linktype="external">Group Policy Collection</a></li>
<li><a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/47ba1311-6cca-414f-98c9-2d7f99fca8a31033.mspx?mfr=true" data-linktype="external">What is Group Policy Object Editor?</a></li>
<li><a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e926577a-5619-4912-b5d9-e73d4bdc94911033.mspx?mfr=true" data-linktype="external">Core Group Policy Tools and Settings</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround</strong>: After the kill bit is set, you will no longer be able to use the OWC Spreadsheet functionality within the Office Web Components ActiveX Control in Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, or any application that honors kill bits. This will not affect the standard operation of Microsoft Office and most users will not notice any change after setting the kill bit. OWC is primarily used by Web applications, including internal business applications, Microsoft Office Project Web Access, and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=38be67a5-2056-46a1-84b1-337ffb549c5c&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Office 2003 Add-in: Web Parts and Components</a>. It may also be used in some VBA solutions within Microsoft Office. Once the kill bit is set, these applications will not be able to use any functionality that relies on the OWC Spreadsheet control within the Office Web Components ActiveX Control.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the Workaround</strong>: You can undo the workaround documented above by following these steps:</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys And Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.</p>
<ul>
<li>To undo the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {0002E543-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} and {0002E55B-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
CLSID_OWC10_Spreadsheet, {0002E541-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0002E543-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]
CLSID_OWC11_Spreadsheet, {0002E559-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{0002E55B-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Unregister the Office Web Components Library</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This action will not work on an ISA Server computer because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Office Web components are installed in the ISA Server program directory (“%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft ISA Server” by default)</li>
<li>The Office Web Components are re-registered by the ISA Server report job mechanism each time a report job is executed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys And Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.</p>
<ul>
<li>For OWC 10, type the following at the command prompt and select <strong>Run:</strong>
Regsvr32.exe /u &quot;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Components\10\owc10.dll&quot;</li>
<li>For OWC 11, type the following at the command prompt and select <strong>Run:</strong>
Regsvr32.exe /u &quot;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Components\11\owc11.dll&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround</strong>: Applications requiring Office Web Components functionality will not function.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the Workaround:</strong> To re-register the Office Web Components, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>For OWC 10, type the following at the command prompt and select <strong>Run:</strong>
Regsvr32.exe &quot;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Components\10\owc10.dll&quot;</li>
<li>For OWC 11, type the following at the command prompt and select <strong>Run:</strong>
Regsvr32.exe &quot;C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Components\11\owc11.dll&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What are Office Web Components?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Office Web Components are a collection of Component Object Model (COM) controls for publishing spreadsheets, charts, and databases to the Web, and for viewing the published components on the Web.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke the ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?</strong><br/>
Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/features.mspx" data-linktype="external">Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by correctly handling memory allocation when the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>For affected versions of ISA Server, the update sets the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">kill bit</a> for all OWC CLSIDs blocking known attack vectors within Internet Explorer. This action does not affect ISA Server functionality.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="office-web-components-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-2496">Office Web Components Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2496</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Office Web Components ActiveX Control. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-2496" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-2496</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-office-web-components-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-2496">Mitigating Factors for Office Web Components Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2496</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed.

<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prevent Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>You can prevent the Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys And Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This is the action taken by the ISA Server update package. No binaries are included in this update for ISA Server.</p>
<p>For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Office Web Components, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Office Web Components library from running.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the library objects are contained are documented in the FAQ &quot;What does the update do?&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {0002E541-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} and {0002E559-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround</strong>: After the kill bit is set, you will no longer be able to use the OWC Spreadsheet functionality within the Office Web Components ActiveX Control in Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, or any application that honors kill bits. This will not affect the standard operation of Microsoft Office and most users will not notice any change after setting the kill bit. OWC is primarily used by Web applications, including internal business applications, Microsoft Office Project Web Access, and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=38be67a5-2056-46a1-84b1-337ffb549c5c&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Office 2003 Add-in: Web Parts and Components</a>. It may also be used in some VBA solutions within Microsoft Office. Once the kill bit is set, these applications will not be able to use any functionality that relies on the OWC Spreadsheet control within the Office Web Components ActiveX Control.</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and &quot;*.update.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to &quot;High&quot; to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-office-web-components-html-script-vulnerability---cve-2009-1136">FAQ for Office Web Components HTML Script Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1136</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control does not correctly handle parameter values and may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What are Office Web Components?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Office Web Components are a collection of Component Object Model (COM) controls for publishing spreadsheets, charts, and databases to the Web, and for viewing the published components on the Web.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke the ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?</strong><br/>
Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/features.mspx" data-linktype="external">Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The security update addresses the vulnerability by performing additional parameter validation.</p>
<p>For affected versions of ISA Server, the update sets the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">kill bit</a> for all OWC CLSIDs blocking known attack vectors within Internet Explorer. This action does not affect ISA Server functionality.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
While the initial report was provided through responsible disclosure, the vulnerability was later disclosed publicly by a separate party. This security bulletin addresses the publicly disclosed vulnerability, as well as additional issues discovered through internal investigations. This vulnerability was first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973472" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 973472</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.</p>
<h2 id="office-web-components-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2009-1534">Office Web Components Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1534</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Office Web Components ActiveX Control. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-1534" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-1534</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-office-web-components-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2009-1534">Mitigating Factors for Office Web Components Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1534</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018</a> has been installed.
The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>

<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and &quot;*.update.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to &quot;High&quot; to prompt before running ActiveX controls in these zones</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-office-web-components-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2009-1534">FAQ for Office Web Components Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-1534</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What are Office Web Components?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Office Web Components are a collection of Component Object Model (COM) controls for publishing spreadsheets, charts, and databases to the Web, and for viewing the published components on the Web.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke the ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?</strong><br/>
Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/features.mspx" data-linktype="external">Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by validating property values with boundary checks when the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.

<p><strong>Note</strong> You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>After you install the update, you cannot remove it. To revert to an installation before the update was installed; you must remove the application, and then install it again from the original media.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>

To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in <strong>Start Search</strong>.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click on the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.</li>

Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in <strong>Start Search</strong>.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click on the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.</li>
<li>You may also click on the <strong>Details</strong> tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.</li>
<li>Finally, you may also click on the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.</li>
</ol>
