<PRE><A HREF="http://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.17.tar.gz">http://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.17.tar.gz</A>
<A HREF="http://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.17.tar.gz.sig">http://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.17.tar.gz.sig</A>

A few director improvements since RC2, some fixes and a new plugin: <A HREF="http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Plugins/QuotaClone">http://wiki2.dovecot.org/Plugins/QuotaClone</A>

	* Dovecot no longer checks or warns if a mountpoint is removed. This
	  was causing more trouble than it was worth. Make sure that all the
	  mountpoints that Dovecot accesses aren't writable by mail processes
	  when they're unmounted.
	* dict server wasn't properly escaping/unescaping data. Fixing this
	  broke backwards compatibility with data that contains line feeds.
	  This hopefully affects only very few installations. If you're using
	  dict to save multiline data (Sieve scripts to SQL), you may be
	  affected.
	* imap: SPECIAL-USE capability is no longer advertised if there are
	  no special_use flags specified for any mailboxes.

	+ lmtp: Added lmtp_hdr_delivery_address setting to specify whether
	  to include email address in Delivered-To: and Received: headers.
	+ Added initial version of full text search library, which includes
	  language-specific text normalization and filtering. This is still
	  in development, but it's already possible to use for testing with
	  fts-lucene and fts-solr.
	+ lda, lmtp: deliver_log_format can now include %{delivery_time},
	  which expands to how many milliseconds it took to deliver the mail.
	  With LMTP %{session_time} also expands to how many milliseconds the
	  LMTP session took, not including the delivery time.
	+ lmtp proxy: Mail delivery logging includes timing information.
	+ imap: Most IMAP commands now include in the tagged reply how many
	  milliseconds it took to run the command (not counting the time spent
	  on waiting for the IMAP client to read/write data).
	+ director: Implemented director_proxy_maybe passdb extra field to
	  be able to run director and backend in the same Dovecot instance.
	  (LMTP doesn't support mixed proxy/non-proxy destinations currently.)
	+ doveadm: Added -F &lt;file&gt; parameter to read a list of users from the
	  given file and run the command for all the users. This is similar to
	  -A parameter reading the list of users from userdb lookup.
	+ Implemented initial Cassandra CQL support as lib-sql backend. It's
	  only usable as dict backend currently.
	+ Added quota-clone plugin to copy current quota usage to a dict.
	- auth: If auth_master_user_separator was set, auth process could be
	  crashed by trying to log in with empty master username.
	- imap-login, pop3-login: Fixed crash on handshake failures with new
	  OpenSSL versions (v1.0.2) when SSLv3 was disabled.
	- auth: If one passdb fails allow_nets check, it shouldn't have failed
	  all the other passdb checks later on.
	- imap: Server METADATA couldn't be accessed
	- imapc: Fixed \Muted label handling in gmail-migration.
	- imapc: Various bugfixes and improvements.
	- Trash plugin fixes by Alexei Gradinari
	- mbox: Fixed crash/corruption in some situations
