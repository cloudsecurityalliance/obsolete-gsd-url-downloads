<h1 id="microsoft-security-bulletin-ms09-072---critical">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS09-072 - Critical</h1>
<h2 id="cumulative-security-update-for-internet-explorer-976325">Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (976325)</h2>
<p>Published: December 08, 2009 | Updated: December 09, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves four privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. An ActiveX control built with Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) headers could also allow remote code execution; for more information about this issue, see the subsection, <strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Internet Explorer: Internet Explorer 5.01, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, Internet Explorer 7 (except when running on supported editions of Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008), and Internet Explorer 8 (except when running on supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2). For Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 running on Windows servers as listed, this update is rated Moderate. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses these vulnerabilities by correcting the control and by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p>This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/977981" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 977981</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> None</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The software listed here have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>

<h2 id="atl-com-initialization-vulnerability---cve-2009-2493">ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2493</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in an ActiveX control built with vulnerable Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) headers. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. Components and controls built using ATL could allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects that can bypass related security policy, such as kill bits within Internet Explorer. Therefore, this vulnerability could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-2493" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-2493</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-atl-com-initialization-vulnerability---cve-2009-2493">Mitigating Factors for ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2493</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 7 and Internet Explorer 8 are not affected by this vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-atl-com-initialization-vulnerability---cve-2009-2493">Workarounds for ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2493</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to &quot;High&quot; to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are <strong>*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</strong> and <strong>*.update.microsoft.com</strong>. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-atl-com-initialization-vulnerability---cve-2009-2493">FAQ for ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2493</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer, instantiating a vulnerable component or control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability results from an ActiveX control built with vulnerable Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) headers. Unsafe usage of this control could allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects that can bypass certain related security policies.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user's system has a vulnerable control and an attacker bypasses the mitigations described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 973882</a>, and if the user is logged on with administrative user rights, then an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What is the component affected by the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The component affected by the vulnerability is tdc.ocx.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting a control that handles tabular data. This control was previously built using vulnerable Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL).</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="html-object-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-3672">HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3672</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-3672" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-3672</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-html-object-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-3672">Mitigating Factors for HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3672</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 and Internet Explorer 8 are not affected by this vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-html-object-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-3672">Workarounds for HTML Object Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3672</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to &quot;High&quot; to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are <strong>*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</strong> and <strong>*.update.microsoft.com</strong>. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting.

Two in particular that you may want to add are <strong>*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</strong> and <strong>*.update.microsoft.com</strong>. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Enable DEP for Internet Explorer 6 or Internet Explorer 7</strong></p>
<p>This vulnerability is more difficult to exploit successfully if Data Execution Protection (DEP) is enabled for Internet Explorer. You can enable DEP for all versions of Internet Explorer that support DEP, using one of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enable DEP for Internet Explorer 7 interactively</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Local Administrators can control DEP/NX by running Internet Explorer as an Administrator. To enable DEP, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Enable memory protection to help mitigate online attacks</strong>.</li>
</ol>
</li>

The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update modifies the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="uninitialized-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-3674">Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3674</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-3674" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-3674</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-uninitialized-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-3674">Mitigating Factors for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3674</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4, Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1, and Internet Explorer 7 are not affected by this vulnerability.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-uninitialized-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-3674">Workarounds for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-3674</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to &quot;High&quot; to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are <strong>*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</strong> and <strong>*.update.microsoft.com</strong>. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.

</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are <strong>*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</strong> and <strong>*.update.microsoft.com</strong>. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>When you install this security update, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.</p>
<p>If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the <strong>Reference Table</strong> in this section.</p>
<p>These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

**Installing the Update**
  
When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Windows hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer will apply the LDR version of this update. Otherwise, the installer will apply the GDR version of the update. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).
