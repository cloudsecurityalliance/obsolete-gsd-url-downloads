    B. FIXES

        Fixes are available.  The fixes can be downloaded via http
        from:

		http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/cmdque_ifix1.tar

        The link above is to a tar file containing this signed
        advisory, fix packages, and PGP signatures for each package.
        The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will
        enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX
        Technology Levels.

        AIX Level                     Interim Fix (*.Z)
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
 |      5.3.12.8                      IV51388s8b.140226.epkg.Z 
 |      6.1.7.8                       IV47427s8b.140226.epkg.Z 
 |      6.1.8.3                       IV47428s3a.140221.epkg.Z
 |      7.1.1.8                       IV47429s8a.140221.epkg.Z 
 |      7.1.2.3                       IV47430s3a.140221.epkg.Z 
   

        To extract the fixes from the tar file:

        tar xvf cmdque_fix1.tar 
        cd cmdque_fix

        Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

        The checksums below were generated using the
        "csum -h SHA1" (sha1sum) command is the followng:

        csum -h SHA1 (sha1sum)                    filename
        ------------------------------------------------------------------
|       b75987ce95b1bbabac2d3e346106eb5f0d833fa0  IV51388s8b.140226.epkg.Z
|       3dd02e731dc5ea74ba690b7a69ee0fb016871490  IV47427s8b.140226.epkg.Z
|       05ad2386fb6bb1589d31d06ef85a11e2ab901ae3  IV47428s3a.140221.epkg.Z
|       de849091161a45500f2a69eaa956a43b619b1dc7  IV47429s8a.140221.epkg.Z
|       aefb9a1e28510758b350ee7de47424f4df095233  IV47430s3a.140221.epkg.Z

        To verify the sum, use the text of this advisory as input to sha1sum.
        For example:

        csum -h SHA1 -i Advisory.asc
        sha1sum -c Advisory.asc

        These sums should match exactly. The PGP signatures in the tar
        file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the
        integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be
        confirmed, contact IBM AIX Security at
        security-alert@austin.ibm.com and describe the discrepancy.

    C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION

        IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
        of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
        readable before proceeding.

        To preview a fix installation:

        installp -a -d fix_name -p all  # where fix_name is the name of the
                                        # fix package being previewed.
        To install a fix package:

        installp -a -d fix_name -X all  # where fix_name is the name of the
                                        # fix package being installed.

        Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression
        testing but not the full regression testing that takes place
        for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

        Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

        http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html

        To preview an interim fix installation:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -p         # where ipkg_name is the name of the
                                     # interim fix package being previewed.

        To install an interim fix package:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -X         # where ipkg_name is the name of the
                                     # interim fix package being installed.

V. WORKAROUNDS

     There are no workarounds.
