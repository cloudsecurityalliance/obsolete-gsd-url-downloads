                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION

    AIX 'named' is an implementation of BIND (Berkeley Internet Name
    Domain) providing server functionality for the Domain Name System
    (DNS) Protocol.  AIX currently ships and supports three versions
    of BIND: 4, 8, and 9.

    There is an error in the handling of dynamic update messages in
    BIND 9.  A crafted update packet from a remote user can cause a
    master server to assert and exit.  Please see the following for
    more information:

    https://www.isc.org/node/474
    
    The successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote,
    unauthenticated user to make a master DNS server assert and exit.

    The following command is vulnerable: 

        /usr/sbin/named9

II. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

    To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following
    command:

    lslpp -L bos.net.tcp.server

    The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

    AIX Fileset           Lower Level       Upper Level

        To extract the fixes from the tar file:

        tar xvf bind_fix.tar
        cd bind_fix

        Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

        The checksums below were generated using the "csum -h SHA1"
        (sha1sum) commands and are as follows:

        csum -h SHA1 (sha1sum)                    filename

        To verify the sums, use the text of this advisory as input to
        csum or sha1sum. For example:

        csum -h SHA1 -i Advisory.asc
        sha1sum -c Advisory.asc

        These sums should match exactly. The PGP signatures in the tar
        file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the
        integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be
        confirmed, contact IBM AIX Security and describe the
        discrepancy at the following address:

            security-alert@austin.ibm.com

     C. INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION

        IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
        of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
        readable before proceeding.

        Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression
        testing but not the full regression testing that takes place
        for Service Packs; thus, IBM does not warrant the fully
        correct functionality of an interim fix.

        Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

        http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html

        To preview an interim fix installation:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -p         # where ipkg_name is the name of the  
                                     # interim fix package being previewed.

        To install an interim fix package:

        emgr -e ipkg_name -X         # where ipkg_name is the name of the  
                                     # interim fix package being installed.

        IMPORTANT: The fix will not take affect until any running BIND
        servers have been stopped and restarted with the following
        commands:
 
            stopsrc -s named
            startsrc -s named
