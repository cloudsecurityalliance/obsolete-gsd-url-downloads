<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-powerpoint-could-allow-remote-code-execution-2489283">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2489283)</h2>
<p>Published: April 12, 2011 | Updated: April 20, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft PowerPoint. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. The automated <strong>Microsoft Fix it</strong> solution for PowerPoint 2010, &quot;Disable Edit in Protected View for PowerPoint 2010,&quot; available in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584</a>, blocks the attack vectors for exploiting the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-0655 and CVE-2011-0656.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft PowerPoint; Microsoft Office for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats; Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer, and Microsoft PowerPoint Web App. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that PowerPoint validates records when opening PowerPoint files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871</a>. For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating" data-linktype="external">Understanding Windows automatic updating</a>.</p>
<p>For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> service.</p>
<p>See also the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, later in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2489283" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2489283</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

**MS11-021 and MS11-023 also describe vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. MS11-021 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011. How do MS11-021 and MS11-023 relate to this bulletin (MS11-022)?**  
The security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2505924), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB2505927), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB2505935) offered in this bulletin also address the vulnerabilities described in the [MS11-021](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210121) and [MS11-023](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210206) security bulletins. The security update package for Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 (KB2525412) offered in this bulletin also addresses the vulnerabilities described in [MS11-021](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210121). Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, Open XML File Format Converter for Mac, or Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 installed will only need to install these security update packages once.
  
**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**   
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.
  
**What is Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer?**   
Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer, which is based on Microsoft Office 2010 technology, is a replacement for Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007 Service Pack 2. Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer lets you view full-featured presentations created in Microsoft PowerPoint 97 and later versions.
  
**I use the "Package a Presentation for CD" feature. How can I help ensure my presentations are protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin?**   
After applying this security update to affected software, customers running supported editions of Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 can issue updated versions of their presentations created using the [Package a Presentation for CD](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/828504) feature in PowerPoint to help ensure that the PowerPoint Viewer included in their presentations is protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.
  
Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 presentations created using the Package a Presentation for CD feature do not include the PowerPoint Viewer.
  
**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?**   
The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.
  
**How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by these vulnerabilities?**   
A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft PowerPoint is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft PowerPoint that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.
  
**The Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**   
Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.
  
**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**   
No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.
  
**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**   
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.
  
It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

<h2 id="floating-point-techno-color-time-bandit-rce-vulnerability---cve-2011-0655">Floating Point Techno-color Time Bandit RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0655</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-0655" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-0655</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-floating-point-techno-color-time-bandit-rce-vulnerability---cve-2011-0655">Mitigating Factors for Floating Point Techno-color Time Bandit RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0655</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, the possibility of an attacker's success in exploiting this vulnerability is reduced due to the protections afforded by the Office File Validation feature enabled in Microsoft Office 2010 by default. Specially crafted files used to exploit the vulnerability open in Protected View and the user is warned that the file is unsafe and potentially harmful because the file failed validation. A user would have to click through multiple warnings and then open the file for editing or saving before the vulnerability could be exploited. For more information about Protected View and Office File Validation, see the TechNet article, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179050.aspx" data-linktype="external">Security Overview for Office 2010</a>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong>  Turning off Office File Validation in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 would remove the protections provided by Office File Validation as a mitigating factor. For this reason, Microsoft recommends not turning off the Office File Validation feature in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-floating-point-techno-color-time-bandit-rce-vulnerability---cve-2011-0655">Workarounds for Floating Point Techno-color Time Bandit RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0655</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Office File Validation to disable editing in protected view in PowerPoint 2010</strong><br/>
<strong>Note</strong>  See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584</a> to use the automated <strong>Microsoft Fix it</strong> solution, &quot;Disable Edit in Protected View for PowerPoint 2010,&quot; to enable or disable this workaround.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>  Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the &quot;Changing Keys And Values&quot; Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the &quot;Add and Delete Information in the Registry&quot; and &quot;Edit Registry Data&quot; Help topics in Regedt32.exe.</p>
<p>To manually apply this workaround:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Registry Editor and navigate to the following registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileValidation</li>
<li>Set the value for <strong>DisableEditFromPV</strong> to &quot;00000001&quot;</li>
<li>Exit Registry Editor</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong>  Office File Validation will no longer allow the editing of suspicious files in PowerPoint 2010.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open Registry Editor and navigate to the following registry key:
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileValidation</li>
<li>Set the value for <strong>DisableEditFromPV</strong> to &quot;00000000&quot;</li>
<li>Exit Registry Editor</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents in Microsoft PowerPoint from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong><br/>
The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<p>For Office 2007</p>
<p><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</code></p>
<p><code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</code></p>
<p><code>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001</code></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>  In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2007, all of the latest security updates for Office 2007 must be applied.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> For Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special exempt directory or have not moved files to a trusted location as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong></p>
<p>For Office 2007</p>
<p><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</code></p>
<p><code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\12.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</code></p>
<p><code>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources</strong><br/>
The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Download Center</a>.</p>
<p>MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit <a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> to install all recommended updates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enable MOICE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865</a> to use the automated <strong>Microsoft Fix it</strong> solution to enable or disable this workaround.</p>

<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a specially crafted PowerPoint file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open the specially crafted PowerPoint file, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted PowerPoint file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where an affected version of Microsoft PowerPoint is used, such as workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update modifies the way that PowerPoint validates TimeColorBehaviorContainer Floating Point records when opening PowerPoint files.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>

<h2 id="persist-directory-rce-vulnerability---cve-2011-0656">Persist Directory RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0656</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2011-0656" data-linktype="external">CVE-2011-0656</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-persist-directory-rce-vulnerability---cve-2011-0656">Mitigating Factors for Persist Directory RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0656</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, the possibility of an attacker's success in exploiting this vulnerability is reduced due to the protections afforded by the Office File Validation feature enabled in Microsoft Office 2010 by default. Specially crafted files used to exploit the vulnerability open in Protected View and the user is warned that the file is unsafe and potentially harmful because the file failed validation. A user would have to click through multiple warnings and then open the file for editing or saving before the vulnerability could be exploited. For more information about Protected View and Office File Validation, see the TechNet article, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179050.aspx" data-linktype="external">Security Overview for Office 2010</a>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong>  Turning off Office File Validation in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 would remove the protections provided by Office File Validation as a mitigating factor. For this reason, Microsoft recommends not turning off the Office File Validation feature in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.</li>

This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
