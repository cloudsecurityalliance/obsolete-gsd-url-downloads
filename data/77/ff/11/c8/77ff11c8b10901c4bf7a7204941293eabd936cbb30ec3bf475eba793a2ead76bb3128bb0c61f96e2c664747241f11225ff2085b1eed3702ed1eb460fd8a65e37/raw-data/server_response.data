                           VULNERABILITY SUMMARY

VULNERABILITY:   Multiple OpenSSL vulnerabilities 

PLATFORMS:       AIX 5.3, 6.1, 7.1, and earlier releases
|                VIOS 2.X and 1.5.2

SOLUTION:        Apply the fix as described below.

THREAT:          See below

CVE Numbers:    CVE-2011-4108
                CVE-2011-4109
                CVE-2011-4576

                CVE-2012-0050

                           DETAILED INFORMATION

I. DESCRIPTION (from cve.mitre.org)

    The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 
    1.0.0f performs a MAC check only if certain padding is valid, which 
    makes it easier for remote attackers to recover plaintext via a 
    padding oracle attack. 

    Double free vulnerability in OpenSSL 0.9.8 before 0.9.8s, when 
    X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is enabled, allows remote attackers to have 
    an unspecified impact by triggering failure of a policy check. 

    The SSL 3.0 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 
    1.0.0f does not properly initialize data structures for block cipher 
    padding, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive 
    information by decrypting the padding data sent by an SSL peer. 

    The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL before 
    0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f does not properly handle handshake 
    restarts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service 
    via unspecified vectors. 

    OpenSSL 0.9.8s and 1.0.0f does not properly support DTLS applications, 
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via 
    unspecified vectors. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an 
    incorrect fix for CVE-2011-4108.

    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-0050

II. PLATFORM VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

    To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following
    command:

    lslpp -L openssl.base

    On VIO Server:

    oem_setup_env
    lslpp -L openssl.base

    The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

    AIX 7.1, 6.1, 5.3: all versions less than or equal 0.9.8.1800
|   AIX 7.1, 6.1, 5.3: FIPS capable versions less than or equal 12.9.8.1800
    AIX 5.2: all versions less than or equal 0.9.8.808
|   VIOS 2.X, 1.5.2: all versions less than or equal 0.9.8.1800

    IMPORTANT: If AIX OpenSSH is in use, it must be updated to version
    OpenSSH 5.0 or later, depending on the OpenSSL version according to
    following compatibility matrix:

    AIX              OpenSSL                    OpenSSH
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    5.2              OpenSSL 0.9.8.80x          OpenSSH 5.0
    5.3,6.1,7.1      OpenSSL 0.9.8.18xx         OpenSSH 5.8.0.61xx
    5.3,6.1,7.1      OpenSSL-fips 12.9.8.18xx   OpenSSH 5.8.0.61xx

|   VIOS             OpenSSL                    OpenSSH
|   ------------------------------------------------------------------
|   2.X,1.5.2        OpenSSL 0.9.8.18x          OpenSSH 5.8.0.61xx

    AIX OpenSSH can be downloaded from:

    OpenSSH 5.0:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/openssh-aix
    OpenSSH 5.8.0.61xx
    https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=aixbp

III. FIXES

    A fix is available, and it can be downloaded from:

    https://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/iwm/web/preLogin.do?source=aixbp

    To extract the fixes from the tar file:

    zcat openssl.0.9.8.1801.tar.Z | tar xvf -
    or
    zcat openssl-fips.12.9.8.1801.tar.Z | tar xvf -
    or
    zcat openssl.0.9.8.809.tar.Z | tar xvf -

    IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup
    of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and
    readable before proceeding.

    To preview the fix installation:

    installp -apYd . openssl

    To install the fix package:

    installp -aXYd . openssl

IV. WORKAROUNDS

    There are no workarounds.
