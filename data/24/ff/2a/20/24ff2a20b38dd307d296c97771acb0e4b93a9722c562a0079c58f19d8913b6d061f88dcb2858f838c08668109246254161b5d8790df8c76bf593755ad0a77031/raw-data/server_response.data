  #### Word Array Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0035:
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Word handles data within an array. A specially crafted file might be included as an e-mail attachment or hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Word file that could allow remote code execution.
  
#### Mitigating factors for Word Array Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2007-0035:
  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Word file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site.  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.  
-   Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) for Office 2000 will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document.

<p><strong>Software Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133" data-linktype="external">Software Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Server Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120" data-linktype="external">Windows Server Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Management Server:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scan Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack</a> and in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161" data-linktype="external">SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack</a>) to install these updates.</p>
