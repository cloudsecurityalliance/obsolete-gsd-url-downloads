For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by improving validation and error handling within the ActiveX controls. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>

The Visual Basic 6.0 Runtime Extended Files include select ActiveX controls, libraries, and tools delivered with the Visual Basic 6.0 Integrated Development Environment (IDE) media and as an online release. Typically, either Visual Basic 6.0 IDE or Microsoft.com installs these files on the development system. The developer then redistributes these files with their applications. Although, as of April 8, 2008, support for Visual Basic 6.0 IDE has ended, Microsoft still offers support for select runtime extended files that are distributed with applications. For more information on support for the Visual Basic 6.0 Runtime Extended Files, please see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbrun/ms788708.aspx" data-linktype="external">Support Statement for Visual Basic 6.0 on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I am a third-party application developer and I use the ActiveX control in my application. Is my application vulnerable and how do I update it?</strong><br/>
Developers who redistribute the ActiveX control should ensure that they update the version of the ActiveX control installed with their application by downloading the update provided in this bulletin. For more information on best practices on redistributed component use, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/835322" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 835322</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa375193.aspx" data-linktype="external">Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I am developing software which contains the redistributable ActiveX control. What do I do?</strong><br/>
You should install the security update included in this security bulletin for your development software. If you have redistributed ActiveX control with your application, you should issue an updated version of your application to your customers with the updated version of this file included in the download of this security update for your development software.</p>
<p><strong>What are the known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932349" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 932349</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?</strong><br/>
Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>, this update includes a defense-in-depth change to the Winsock Control, mswinsck.ocx. This change involves setting the kill bit for the class ID with a value of {248dd896-bb45-11cf-9abc-0080c7e7b78d}.</p>
<p>By default, Internet Explorer will not instantiate the Winsock ActiveX Control as it is not marked as safe for scripting. Thus, by default, customers are not at risk from a Web-based attack. However, customers may be at risk via third-party applications that distribute and use mswinsck.ocx.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>
<p>It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

<h2 id="datagrid-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4252">DataGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4252</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the DataGrid ActiveX Control for Visual Basic 6. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-4252" data-linktype="external">CVE-2008-4252</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-datagrid-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4252">Mitigating Factors for DataGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4252</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-datagrid-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4252">Workarounds for DataGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4252</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Prevent DataGrid ActiveX Control from running in Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.</p>
<p>For detailed steps that you can use to prevent an ActiveX control from running in Internet Explorer, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-datagrid-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4252">FAQ for DataGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4252</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke the ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?</strong><br/>
Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/features.mspx" data-linktype="external">Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by handling errors for improperly initialized objects within the ActiveX Control.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-flexgrid-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4253">FAQ for FlexGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4253</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke the ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?</strong><br/>
Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/features.mspx" data-linktype="external">Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by handling errors for improperly initialized objects within the ActiveX control.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="hierarchical-flexgrid-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4254">Hierarchical FlexGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4254</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Hierarchical FlexGrid ActiveX Control for Visual Basic 6. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-4254" data-linktype="external">CVE-2008-4254</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-hierarchical-flexgrid-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4254">Mitigating Factors for Hierarchical FlexGrid Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4254</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>

<h2 id="charts-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4256">Charts Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4256</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Charts ActiveX Control for Visual Basic 6. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-4256" data-linktype="external">CVE-2008-4256</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-charts-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4256">Mitigating Factors for Charts Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4256</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ subsection of this vulnerability section for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps mitigate attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting and ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="faq-for-charts-control-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2008-4256">FAQ for Charts Control Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2008-4256</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When the ActiveX control is used in Internet Explorer, the control may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could run arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted Web site that is designed to invoke the ActiveX control through Internet Explorer. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003 or Windows Server 2008. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and Windows Server 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055" data-linktype="external">Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What is the ActiveX opt-in feature in Windows Internet Explorer 7?</strong><br/>
Windows Internet Explorer 7 includes an ActiveX opt-in feature, which means that nearly all pre-installed ActiveX controls are off by default. Users are prompted by the Information Bar before they can instantiate a previously installed ActiveX control that has not yet been used on the Internet. This enables a user to permit or deny access on a control-by-control basis. For more information about this and other new features, see the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/ie/features.mspx" data-linktype="external">Windows Internet Explorer 7 features page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by handing errors for improperly initialized objects within the ActiveX control.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit</strong></p>
<p>Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the <a href="http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de1033.mspx?mfr=true" data-linktype="external">Update Compatibility Evaluator</a> components included with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Application Compatibility Toolkit 5.0</a>.</p>
<p>The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.</p>

<p><strong>Installing the Update</strong></p>
<p>You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section.

<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>This update cannot be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>

<p><strong>Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the Search Results pane, click All files and folders under Search Companion.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
