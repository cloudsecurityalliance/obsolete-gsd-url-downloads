<p>The software in this list has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>This update resolves several newly discovered, privately reported and public vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own &quot;Vulnerability Details&quot; section.</p>
<p>When using vulnerable versions of Office, if a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the client workstation. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>We recommend that customers apply the update immediately</p>

<h4 id="microsoft-excel-malformed-selection-record-vulnerability---cve-2006-1301">Microsoft Excel Malformed SELECTION record Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1301</h4>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Excel that results from the processing of a malformed SELECTION record. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Excel file that could allow remote code execution.</p>
<p>If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-microsoft-excel-malformed-selection-record-vulnerability---cve-2006-1301">Mitigating Factors for Microsoft Excel Malformed SELECTION record Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1301:</h4>
<ul>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>On Outlook 2002 and Outlook 2003, the vulnerability could not be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must accept a prompt confirming that they <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> or <strong>Cancel</strong> the attachment that is sent in an e-mail message before the exploit could occur.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>

<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or instant messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted file to the user and by persuading the user to open the file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Excel validates the length of a record before it passes the message to the allocated buffer.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Administrative Deployment Information</strong></p>
<p>To update your administrative installation, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/f/f/4ffb141e-2294-4942-a73c-028220283408/office2000-kb918424-fullfile-enu.exe" data-linktype="external">Download the security update for Excel 2000</a>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save this program to disk</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
<li>Using Windows Explorer, locate the folder that contains the saved file. Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type the following command, and then click <strong>OK</strong> to extract the .msp file:<br/>
<strong>[path\name of EXE file] /c /t:C:\AdminUpdate</strong><br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Double-clicking the .exe file does not extract the .msp file; it applies the update to the local computer. In order to update an administrative image, you must first extract the .msp file.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to accept the License Agreement.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> if you are prompted to create the folder.</li>
<li>If you are familiar with the procedure for updating your administrative installation, click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type the following command, and then click <strong>OK</strong>:<br/>
<strong>msiexec /a</strong> <em>Admin Path</em>**\**MSI File **/p C:\AdminUpdate\**<em>MSP File</em> <strong>SHORTFILENAMES=TRUE</strong><br/>
<strong>Note</strong> <em>Admin Path</em> is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), <em>MSI File</em> is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and <em>MSP File</em> is the name of the administrative update (for example, SHAREDff.msp).<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> You can append /<strong>qb+</strong> to the command line so that the <strong>Administrative Installation</strong> dialog box and the <strong>End User License Agreement</strong> dialog box do not appear.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Next</strong> in the provided dialog box. Do not change your CD key, installation location, or company name in the provided dialog box.</li>
<li>Click <strong>I accept the terms in the License Agreement</strong>, and then click <strong>Install</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, your administrative installation point is updated. Next, you must update the workstations configurations that were originally installed from this administrative installation. To do this, please review the “Workstation Deployment Information” section. Any new installations that you run from this administrative installation point will include the update.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> Any workstation configuration that was originally installed from this administrative installation before you installed the update cannot use this administrative installation for actions like repairing Office or adding new features until you complete the steps in the “Workstation Deployment Information” section for this workstation.</p>
<p><strong>Workstation Deployment Information</strong></p>
<p>To deploy the update to the client workstations, click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type the following command, and then click <strong>OK</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>msiexec /I</strong> <em>Admin Path</em>**\**MSI File **/qb REINSTALL=**Feature List <strong>REINSTALLMODE=vomu</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> <em>Admin Path</em> is the path of your administrative installation point for your application (for example, C:\Office2000), <em>MSI File</em> is the .msi database package for the application (for example, Data1.msi), and <em>Feature List</em> is the list of feature names (case sensitive) that must be reinstalled for the update.</p>
<p>To install all features, you can use <strong>REINSTALL=ALL</strong> or you can install the following features.</p>

<p><strong>Software Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy security updates by using Software Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133" data-linktype="external">Software Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Server Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates for Windows 2000 operating systems and later, Office XP and later, Exchange Server 2003, and SQL Server 2000 onto Windows 2000 and later operating systems.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy security updates using Windows Server Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50120" data-linktype="external">Windows Server Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Management Server:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack</a> and in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161" data-linktype="external">SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack</a>) to install these updates.</p>
