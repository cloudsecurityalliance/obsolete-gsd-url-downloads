<td align=left>17,920 bytes<br>07/03/2014
<td align=left>FLACOUT optimizes the size of .FLAC audio files losslessly. With the right options, it can often beat the reference encoder by 3-5%. It does an exhaustive search (except for block splits) and was designed to optimize compression. Due to its slow speed, it is best to run it only on small files. ;-) Note: headers will be stripped.

<td align=left>The professional version of PNGOUT, featuring an easy-to-use GUI. Supports all features of the command line version (described below), plus more. PNGOUTWin makes it easier to do batch processing and takes full advantage of multi-core CPUs. Please visit <a href="http://ardfry.com/pngoutwin/">ardfry.com</a> for more information.

<td align=left>38,912 bytes<br>02/13/2015
<td align=left>PNGOUT optimizes the size of .PNG files losslessly. It uses the same deflate compressor I wrote for KZIP.EXE (see below). With the right options, it can often beat other programs by 5-10%. That includes pngcrush -brute, optipng -o7, advpng -z4, etc.. PNGOUT is a great tool for optimizing the size of web pages or squeezing game content onto mobile devices. Almost all .PNG files on my website were optimized with PNGOUT. For a detailed description of the options, please check out the <a href="util/pngout.htm">PNGOUT tutorial</a> written by Kerry Watson. Click <a href="#pngoutkziplicense">here</a> for license. For a changelog, see: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121027135529/http://www.jonof.id.au/forum/index.php?topic=1515.0">here</a> or <a href="http://www.jonof.id.au/kenutils">here</a>.<td align=left>WIN32 command line

<tr valign=top>
<td align=left><a href="util/pnghalf.exe">PNGHALF.EXE</a>
<td align=left>32,768 bytes<br>07/30/2020
<td align=left>PNGHALF is a simple utility which halves the dimensions of an image file by averaging the R/G/B/A of each group of 2x2 pixels - very handy for when you work with artists who like to make "1300-pixel arrows". ;-) Output files are NOT compressed so it is highly recommended to run a PNG re-compressor (such as PNGOUT above) on the results.<td align=left>WIN32 command line

<td align=left>14,848 bytes<br>04/14/2007
<td align=left>My own PKZIP-compatible compressor focusing on space over speed. KZIP creates smaller .ZIP files than PKZIP with maximum compression enabled and even beats 7-Zip most of the time. I use a few tricks beyond what your typical compressor will do. The main one is an exhaustive search of all patterns. The other one is my advanced block splitter. ZIP files created with KZIP are compatible with all of the latest .ZIP software - just that if you use KZIP, your file will probably be smaller. Decompression is still very fast, making KZIP the perfect tool for shaving off seconds from download times.  What will you do for a byte? :) Click <a href="#pngoutkziplicense">here</a> for license.

<td align=left><a href="util/zipmix.exe">ZIPMIX.EXE</a>
<td align=left>9,216 bytes<br>05/01/2016
<td align=left>Sometimes, when you run 2 different .ZIP programs on the same data (PKZIP & KZIP for example), some files get compressed better in one program, while other files get compressed better in the other. ZIPMIX will take the best files from each one and create a new output file, which is guaranteed to be equal to or smaller in size to both of the input files. ZIPMIX can also be used to perform boolean operations on ZIP files, such as merging 2 ZIP files together, or updating a new file (with some tricks). You can download the source code here: <a href="util/zipmix_src.zip">ZIPMIX_SRC.ZIP</a> (5,232 bytes, 05/01/2016) This code may be used freely.

<td align=left><a href="util/rekzip.zip">REKZIP.ZIP</a>
<td align=left>379 bytes<br>07/06/2006
<td align=left>Here's a little batch file I wrote for KZIP to directly re-compress an existing ZIP file. I have tried to make the batch file as safe as possible - meaning you shouldn't lose the original file if there's an error during one of the steps. I think the worst that can happen is you end up with a harmless temporary sub-directory - and that's only if your computer freezes! If you really want to feel cool, you can re-compress a whole directory of ZIP files using this command: "for %i in (*.zip) do rekzip %i" : ) Someday, I might actually get around to integrating this functionality into KZIP.EXE..

It supports a fancy 4x4 filter (uses MMX code) to interpolate samples cleanly when you use the zoom feature. This is a high quality filter - most 3D accelerators use bilinear interpolation which is only a 2x2 filter :) There are 3 interpolation modes; use TAB to select between them. (Mode 0:4x4 when stopped/nearest when moving, Mode 1:4x4 always, Mode 2:nearest always). (See <a href="util/pngout.htm">PNGOUT.HTM</a> for a more complete description of supported image formats)

<td align=left>Want to see how fast you can type? Using this program, you can type in any text and it will report the number of words you typed, how many seconds it took you, and how fast you typed it in words per minute. On 02/11/2000, I typed "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." in 2.683 seconds - that's 201.233 words per minute! On 06/28/1999, I typed the names of all 50 U.S. states in alphabetical order (60 words, no capitalization) in 45.094 seconds. I challenge you to beat me! Don't be discouraged though - I'm really, REALLY FAST! You should be proud of yourself if you can get half my score.

<td align=left>Tests the speed of VBE/AF graphic modes. Too bad that the VBE/AF specification seems to not have caught on. To obtain a VBE/AF driver, you can try installing Scitech Display Doctor (www.scitechsoft.com), which puts a file called VBEAF.DRV in the root of your hard drive.

<td align=left>Plays WAV or VOC files through the PC speaker. Works in Windows 95/98, but not quite at the same quality as DOS because Windows has no GOOD way of disabling interrupts. Includes source; compile with <a href="http://openwatcom.org/">Watcom C</a>.

<td align=left>Just another MP3 player. Code is based on MPG12304.ZIP, but I optimized the player quite a bit and has a couple of silly features like an alarm. Features low CPU usage. Requires an SB-compatible card.

<td align=left>Got no sound card? MP3PC plays MP3 files through your PC speaker! For some reason I like to make programs work through the PC speaker. Some people still don't know that it's possible to play real sounds through it. Unfortunately, you must run this in pure DOS mode for it to work.

<td align=left>KeN's Change Directory. If you like jumping to different directories quickly, you should try my version of the program, based on one of my favorite Norton Utilities. My NCD program is extremely small and fast. One cool feature is that it stores the entire directory tree (skips hidden directories) in the "NCD.EXE" program file itself. This keeps your HD from getting cluttered and makes the program load even faster.

<td align=left>This utility is for the serious QuickBasic programmer who is stuck using WinXP. In WinXP, some old DOS programs (such as Microsoft QuickBasic) stupidly access the floppy drive when you do File..Open. This is really annoying because it wastes 2 seconds while it does this. FLOPPY.COM fixes this behavior by disabling the floppy drive. As a side effect, you can't access the floppy drive until you re-enable it. At the command prompt, type "floppy off" to disable the floppy drive and "floppy on" or "floppy" to enable the floppy drive.
