<H3>CVSS 3.0 Scoring and Metrics:</H3>
<P>Avaya uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System version 3 
(CVSSv3) base score and metrics as reported by the vendor for the affected component(s) or by the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the National Vulnerability Database. In some cases, such as where CVSS information is not available from the vendor or NIST, Avaya will calculate the CVSSv3 base score and metrics. Customers are encouraged to calculate the Temporal and Environmental CVSSv3 scores to determine how the vulnerability could affect their specific implementation or environment.
