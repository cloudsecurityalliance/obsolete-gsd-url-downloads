<li>We improved the UI around creating a message definition in the Desktop Modeler. When selecting an entity while the message definition name was empty, the name was not being set to the entity name. This was working up to Mendix version 7.23.1.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in consumed web services where using a custom request body without headers using the <a href="/refguide7/project-settings#web-service-calls">new web services implementation</a> no longer accepted a custom body with an envelope. (Ticket 78564)</li>
<li>When an end-user is accessing a page URL without sufficient privileges, the login page will now show this message: “You don’t have enough permissions to access this page. You may try to log in as a different user.” (Ticket 46929)</li>
<li>When an end-user is accessing a page URL without sufficient privileges, they might want an easy way to go back to the home page. If your theme does not already contain a <strong>Go home</strong> button, you must now add a button with the <code>goHomeButton</code> ID in your login page in your theme. This button will only be shown when the end-user is trying to access a page URL they do not have permission to access. (Tickets 46929, 68401)</li>
<li>A customized sign-in page now plays nicely with the page URL functionality. (Tickets 67469, 68401)</li>
<li>The document exporter will now use country-specific currency formatting if such a language is selected. (Ticket 80402)</li>
<li>We fixed a bug where menu items with a <strong>Create object</strong> action were not hidden, even when the end-user did not have enough privileges. (Ticket 82188)</li>
<li>Hovering over an empty row in a data grid resulted in a Javascript error in the client. We fixed this. (Ticket 79747)</li>
<li>When the widget updater was determining the link to the Mendix Marketplace, it erroneously updated the version of that widget without actually updating the widget. As a result, the widget updater showed all the widgets as &ldquo;up to date,&rdquo; while that was not the case. This has been fixed.</li>
<li>We fixed an out-of-memory issue on cluster slaves caused by persistent session objects. (Ticket 80910)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the <code>isSynced</code> expression was not up-to-date after synchronizing. (Ticket 80709)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where conditional visibility only worked after a retrieve action for objects with an association. (Ticket 77931)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the CSV export of decimal values contained spaces. (Ticket 80694)</li>
<li>When a non-anonymous end-user logged in to a hybrid offline app, the home page of the anonymous user role was opened. The end-user&rsquo;s home page is now opened based on their role. (Ticket 79182)</li>
<li>We fixed an error that occurred when snippets did not have an entity set yet. (Ticket 78495)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where login messages where not be translated. (Ticket 79325)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in published OData services where the service feed did not have a title for the workspace, even though that is required. (Thanks to <a href="https://forum.mendixcloud.com/link/ideas/1357">Ronald van Puijenbroek</a> for pointing this out on the <a href="https://forum.mendixcloud.com/link/ideas/1357">Mendix Idea Forum</a>!)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the Desktop Modeler crashed when previewing images that were very narrow. (Ticket 80161)</li>
<li>We removed the <strong>Get Started</strong> page from the interface, because it is no longer actively used and under certain circumstances it caused a crash. (Ticket 81645)</li>
<li>We made it clear in the <strong>Scheduled Event</strong> editor that a month is treated as 31 days and a year as 365 days when repeating an event. (Ticket 51421)</li>
<li>We fixed a situation where data set access was out-of-date without showing an error. (Ticket 80381)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where you could not configure a Java action call with a lot of parameters. (Ticket 55350)</li>
<li>You will not encounter errors anymore when debugging an application from Eclipse with a default runtime port. (Tickets 63971, 64886, 68651)</li>

<h3 id="new-features-2">New Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>We added <strong>collaborative development process</strong> – a new way of sharing model changes. It allows team members to work together in the Desktop Modeler and the Web Modeler without using <strong>Sync with Web Modeler</strong>. When the Desktop Modeler user presses <strong>Update</strong> or <strong>Commit</strong>, the Web Modeler changes are committed and merged automatically. For more information on the new process, see <a href="/refguide7/collaborative-development">Collaborative Development</a>.
<div class="alert

role="alert"><p>Existing projects with Mendix version 7.23.2 or below can continue using <strong>Sync with Web Modeler</strong> until September 2019.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>We added support for SAP HANA database as a relational database back end on SAP Cloud Platform.</li>
<li>We added support for AdoptOpenJDK. If you install the Desktop Modeler and you do not have Oracle&rsquo;s JDK or AdoptOpenJDK installed, the installer will install AdoptOpenJDK.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixes-20">Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>We fixed an issue in the <a href="/refguide7/call-web-service-action">call web service action</a> where selecting <strong>Simple expressions for each request parameter</strong> resulted in a <code>(content)</code> element in the request body. (Ticket 77690)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in the <a href="/refguide7/call-web-service-action">call web service action</a> where in case the server returned an error, not all memory was freed. The error message in this scenario was “WARNING - Jetty: (<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub>) java.io.IOException: Too many open files.” (Tickets 77649, 81835, 82129, 82198)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in <a href="/refguide7/export-mappings">export mappings</a> based on <a href="/refguide7/message-definitions">message definitions</a> where setting the <strong>Send empty values</strong> to <strong>Yes, as null</strong> and exporting an empty association would result in an internal JSON exception.

<li>We fixed an issue where loading data in a <strong>Text</strong> widget over association failed in Internet Explorer 11. (Tickets 80240, 80947, 81000, 81219, 81449)</li>
<li>When an object over association was fetched in a data view or an <strong>Image</strong> widget while the starting object was not available, this caused an exception. We fixed this issue. (Ticket 79182)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the roles of a page used in a menu widget were changed, and the page containing the menu widget was not updated during fast redeploy.</li>
<li>Excluded documents can be exported and imported now. (Ticket 79631)</li>
<li>We applied changes in access rules with XPath constraints to committed persistable entities at the end of a microflow. (Tickets 56500, 64294, 65312, 76585)</li>

<ul>
<li>We fixed an issue in <a href="/refguide7/published-odata-services">published OData services</a> that occurs where a client requests a single associated object that is not there, the result is now <code>204 No Content</code> instead of <code>200 OK</code>.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in <a href="/refguide7/published-rest-services">published REST services</a> where using multiple path parameters but having them in a different order in the list resulted in the wrong values. A consistency error is now shown for this situation. (Ticket 78323)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where closing and opening a page intertwined and lead to unexpected behavior. (Ticket 67688)</li>
<li>When the <code>isNew</code> function was used with an empty object it threw an error. We fixed that and return <code>false</code> now in such a case. (Ticket 78555)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where offline app synchronization failed when synchronized file entities had security constraints. (Ticket 76082)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the previous page was briefly shown when closing a form and opening a new form with a nanoflow. (Tickets 76083, 78605, 79392)</li>
<li><a name="79881"></a> We fixed an issue where custom widgets that subscribe using the <code>this.subscribe</code> function and unsubscribe using <code>mx.data.unsubscribe</code> got an error when calling <code>mx.data.unsubscribe</code>. (Tickets 79881, 80075, 80078, 80174)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where a data grid tooltip was displayed with missing data. (Ticket 78301)</li>
<li>We check whether your project needs to be updated from the Team Server before you see the <strong>Commit Message</strong> dialog box. (Ticket 79316)</li>
<li>When passing the command-line parameter <code>--enable-chrome-dev-tools</code>, the Chrome developer tools in the <strong>Sign-in</strong> dialog box will be opened. This is done for diagnostic purposes. Also, we added a lot of logging for the sign-in process so that we can find out why people are having trouble signing in to the Modeler. (Ticket 78510, 79012, 78899)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the list of ignored files keeps growing with every branch that you create. In extreme cases this could even lead to the modeler crashing while merging. To prevent crashes in projects that already have large ignore lists, the feature that automatically resolves conflicts on ignore lists has been disabled. From now on, conflicts on ignore lists will be rare, because we change the ignore list less often. If you still encounter conflicts on the svn:ignore property, they have to be resolved by using TortoiseSVN. (Ticket 78557)</li>
<li>We automatically ignore the folder <code>node_modules</code> to avoid committing thousands of files accidentally.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where creating multiple sessions was allowed for a single user when multiple sessions were not allowed in the Modeler. (Tickets 78405, 79370, 79520)</li>

<li>No need to wonder what <a href="https://marketplace.mendix.com/">Marketplace</a> widgets you are using in your project and to find a way to check if you have the latest version anymore! In <strong>Project</strong> &gt; <strong>Tools</strong> we added the <strong>Update Widgets</strong> setting which gives you an overview of the widgets you are using, what their current version is in your project, and what the latest version is. Moreover, you can now select several widgets and update them by simultaneously clicking <strong>Update</strong>.

</div>
</li>
<li>It is now possible to set the render mode of a container widget as one of the HTML5 section tags (for example, <code>main</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>footer</code>).</li>
<li>We improved the accessibility of pop-up windows and pages in pop-up layouts.</li>
<li>Syncing files for offline apps is much faster now! We only synchronize changed files, which saves a lot of network traffic and time. In addition, resiliency to network failures during file download has been improved: the offline database is not updated with changes from the server until all network operations are completed.</li>
<li>The <strong>List operation</strong> activity is now supported in nanoflows.</li>
<li>We improved the build time of your project. This was possible by replacing Bnd for packaging the Java part of the project.</li>
<li>We fixed the issue with the <strong>Get Started</strong> pane which was not display anything when a user was not signed in.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where some technical details (the <strong>Mics</strong> panel) were displayed in Java actions properties.</li>
<li>When reverting a renamed Java action, dataset, or consumed app service, the associated files are also renamed. When reverting a renamed module, files in this module are moved.</li>
<li>We support the custom setting <code>DatabaseJdbcUrl</code> for PostgreSQL databases too (this setting was already supported for the other database types).</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where a database failover could lead to a Jetty ThreadPool exhaustion, preventing requests from being handled and causing the system to report a &ldquo;low on resources&rdquo; warning.</li>

<h3 id="fixes-23">Fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>We added a missing consistency check for the <strong>Aggregate list</strong> action, so your aggregate action will not fail in runtime if you are using an attribute that does not belong to the selected entity. (Ticket 77198)

<ul>
<li><strong>Conversion fix</strong>: For a selected attribute on the <strong>Aggregate list</strong> action that cannot be found as a part of the entity of the input variable, we now change it to an attribute with the same name if it exists on the entity. This conversion ensures that users will not get consistency errors.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a name="78468"></a>We fixed an issue where it was not possible to commit after merging in a branch. (Tickets 78468, 78322, 79166, 78542, 76785, 77955, 77245)</li>
<li>It is now possible to use <strong>Override</strong> and <strong>Deprecated</strong> as entity names without running into Java compilation problems. (Ticket 53711)</li>
<li>We now refresh input forms in the Modeler after using the <strong>Show</strong> button so that information gets updated. (Ticket 39000)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where double-clicking did not work in the domain model editor if you programmed your mouse to double-click for you. (This one is for you, Marcel!)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where a deprecation warning appeared in the log if you used a report grid or a report chart. (Ticket 68270, 70168)</li>
<li>For a better user experience, mobile devices will now use the native date/time picker even if a custom format has been configured. (Ticket 67091)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where if the first tab of a tab container was initially hidden with conditional visibility, the next visible tab was not activated correctly. (Ticket 66929)</li>
<li>Previously, a data grid search field for an attribute of enumeration type showed an additional empty option in the drop-down menu, which was confusing and led to zero results in the search. We fixed this by replacing it with an option that allows you to search specifically for rows where the attribute is empty. (Ticket 66129)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where copying the contents of an editable grid cell with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> caused the text &ldquo;C&rdquo; to appear in the cell. (Ticket 77075)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where a list view listening to another widget within the same data view did not always refresh correctly when that data view was refreshed. (Ticket 77305)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where signing out did not work correctly after following an anchor link. (Ticket 76708)</li>
<li>We improved the performance of pages that contain a lot of text or button widgets. (Ticket 76125, 76341)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where an object with a required validation received a validation error from an on-change microflow. As a result, the changed value was cleared, and the object with the previous (correct) value was saved, instead of being blocked with a validation message due to the required validation. (Ticket 62739)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where clicking a microflow button twice was possible even if <strong>Disabled during action</strong> was set. (Ticket 76020)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where returning a string value from a nanoflow failed. (Ticket 69895)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the <strong>Retrieve</strong> action over an association in a nanoflow returned <code>empty</code> for a list variable. (Ticket 76491)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where closing the current page and opening a new one from a microflow resulted in opening the previous page. (Tickets 66534, 76966, 79169)</li>
<li>We now show a consistency error when a <strong>Show page</strong> action has specializations configured and the default page does not accept a context parameter. (Ticket 70079)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where non-persistable objects were attempted to be synchronized for offline apps. They are filtered out now. In addition, suppport for committing non-persistable objects in offline apps has been added. (Ticket 65805)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in <a href="/refguide7/import-mappings">import mappings</a> where is was not possible to pass the mapping argument to the microflow selected in the <strong>Call a Microflow</strong> method.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in <a href="/refguide7/export-mappings">export mappings</a> where mapping different specializations of an entity resulted in an error. (Ticket 76307)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in <a href="/refguide7/import-mappings">XML import mappings</a> where the mapping failed because <code>find by key</code> was used for a key that was the content of an XML node. (Ticket 76438)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in the <a href="/refguide7/message-definition">message definition editor</a> where filtering expanded the tree so far that the Modeler could become unresponsive. (Ticket 77195)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue in the <a href="/refguide7/message-definition">message definition editor</a> where after changing the association, the <strong>Refresh</strong> button did not fix the consistency error. (Ticket 77187)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the debugger shortcut keys (for example, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F6</kbd>) were not working. (Ticket 78125)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the <strong>Mendix Console Log</strong> application was crashing while showing a dialog box.</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where re-ordering sub-widgets (for example, data grid columns) was more difficult than intended. (Ticket 77423)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where an object which was initially auto-committed and then explicitly committed in a before-commit action was still treated as auto-committed one. (Ticket 78384)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the locales of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Yemen, and Myanmar used non-western digits. (Ticket 77676)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue where the <strong>Extract as sub-microflow</strong> functionality for loops with objects inside resulted in duplicated parameters and consistency errors. (Ticket 77673)</li>
<li>We fixed a unique constraint violation because of duplicate keys, because of incorrect client/server communication about objects when microflows are running in the background. (Ticket 78210, 78407, 78478, 78588, 78688, 79489)</li>
<li>We fixed an issue reported through the <a href="https://forum.mendixcloud.com/link/questions/92436">Mendix Forum</a> where the Modeler window was not visible when used in multiple screen setups.</li>
