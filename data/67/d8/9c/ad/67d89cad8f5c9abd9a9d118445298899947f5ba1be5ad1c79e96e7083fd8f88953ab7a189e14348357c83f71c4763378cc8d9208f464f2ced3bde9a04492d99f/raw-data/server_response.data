<h2 id="cumulative-security-update-for-internet-explorer-867282">Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (867282)</h2>
<p>Published: February 08, 2005</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<p><strong>Issued:</strong> February 8, 2005<br/>
<strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p><strong>Who should read this document:</strong> Customers who use Microsoft Windows</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Vulnerability:</strong> Remote Code Execution</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Severity Rating:</strong> Critical</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Customers should apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Security Update Replacement</strong> This update replaces the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851" data-linktype="external">MS04-038</a>. That update is also a cumulative update. This update also replaces the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38098" data-linktype="external">MS04-040</a>. That update is also a cumulative update for Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/867282" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 867282</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/867282" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 867282</a>.</p>
<p>This update does include hotfixes that have been released since the release of <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189" data-linktype="external">MS04-004</a> or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981" data-linktype="external">MS04-025</a> but they will only be installed on systems that need them. Customers who have received hotfixes from Microsoft or from their support providers since the release of <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189" data-linktype="external">MS04-004</a> or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31981" data-linktype="external">MS04-025</a> should review the FAQ “I have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this security update?” in the FAQ section for this update to determine how to ensure that the necessary hotfixes are installed. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/867282" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 867282</a> also documents this in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The update for the “Drag-and-Drop Vulnerability” (CAN-2005-0053) comes in two parts. It is addressed in part in this security bulletin. This security bulletin, together with security bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38516" data-linktype="external">MS05-008</a>, makes up the update for CAN-2005-0053. These updates do not have to be installed in any particular order. However, we recommend that you install both updates.</p>

<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This update resolves several newly-discovered, publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own “Vulnerability Details” section.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.</p>

<p><strong>I have received a hotfix from Microsoft or my support provider since the release of MS04-004. Is that hotfix included in this security update?</strong><br/>
Yes. When you install the security update intended for systems running Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 3, on Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4, or on Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. However, the installer only detects hotfixes released since Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851" data-linktype="external">MS04-038</a> and Internet Explorer update rollup <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=873377" data-linktype="external">873377</a> or Internet Explorer update rollup <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/889669" data-linktype="external">889669</a>.
See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/867282" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 867282</a> for additional information if you need to apply a hotfix released before Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851" data-linktype="external">MS04-038</a> on a system with the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=37180" data-linktype="external">MS05-014</a> update installed.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?</strong><br/>
Yes. Besides the changes that are listed in the “Vulnerability Details” section of this bulletin, this update includes the following security changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>This update sets the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">kill bit</a> for the Microsoft ActiveX Image Control 1.0. This control implements support for dynamically changing images on a Web page. Internet Explorer no longer supports this control. This control has been found to contain a security vulnerability. To help protect customers who have this control installed, this update prevents the control from running in Internet Explorer. It does this by setting the kill bit for the control. For more information about kill bits, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">240797</a>. The CLSID for this ActiveX control is {D4A97620-8E8F-11CF-93CD-00AA00C08FDF}.</li>
<li>Like the previous Internet Explorer cumulative security updates that have been released since <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22189" data-linktype="external">MS04-004</a>, this update includes a change to the functionality of a clear-text authentication feature in Internet Explorer. The update removes Internet Explorer’s support for handling user names and passwords in HTTP URLs, in HTTP with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) URLs, or in HTTPS URLs. The following URL syntax is no longer supported in Internet Explorer or in Windows Explorer after you install this software update:
http(s)://<em>username</em>:<em>password</em>@<em>server</em>/<em>resource</em>.<em>ext</em>
<em>For more information about this change, please see</em> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834489" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 834489</a>.</li>

<h2 id="vulnerability-details">Vulnerability Details</h2>
<h4 id="drag-and-drop-vulnerability---can-2005-0053">Drag-and-Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0053</h4>
<p>A privilege elevation vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that Internet Explorer handles drag-and-drop events. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page. This malicious Web page could potentially allow an attacker to save a file on the user’s system if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-drag-and-drop-vulnerability---can-2005-0053">Mitigating Factors for Drag-and-Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0053:</h4>
<ul>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, Microsoft Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-018" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.
The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040" data-linktype="external">MS03-040</a> or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Use the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update, use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-drag-and-drop-vulnerability---can-2005-0053">Workarounds for Drag-and-Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0053:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable “Drag and Drop or copy and paste files” in Internet Explorer</strong><br/>
Disable “Drag and Drop or copy and paste files” in Internet Explorer by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Obtain and install the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31851" data-linktype="external">MS04-038</a> Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer. This security update must be installed for these configuration steps to be effective.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disable the <strong>Drag and drop or copy and paste files</strong> option in the Internet and Intranet Web content zones. Disable the Drag and drop or copy and paste files option in the Internet and local intranet zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Settings</strong> box, locate the <strong>Drag and drop or copy and paste files</strong> option under <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>. Make a note of your current setting.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Drag and drop or copy and paste files</strong>, click <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong> two times.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Repeat these steps for the local intranet zone by clicking <strong>Local intranet</strong> instead of <strong>Internet</strong> in step 2. These steps are also outlined in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888534" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 888534</a> where steps on how to restore your previous drag and drop or copy and paste files setting are outlined.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in these zones.</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings,</strong> in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins,</strong> click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.</strong><br/>
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.</strong><br/>
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.</p>
<p>Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594</a>.</p>
<p>For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.</li>
<li>Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.</li>
<li>Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="faq-for-drag-and-drop-vulnerability---can-2005-0053">FAQ for Drag-and-Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0053:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability involves drag and drop events in Internet Explorer. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause an executable file to be saved on the user's system. The user would not receive a dialog box requesting approval for the download. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to host a malicious Web site that contained a Web page that was designed to exploit this vulnerability and then persuade a user to visit that site. If the user took certain actions on that Web page, executable files of the attacker's choice could be saved in specified locations on the user's system.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Drag-and-Drop technology incorrectly validates some dynamic HTML (DHTML) events. This vulnerability permits a file to be downloaded to the user's system after the user clicks a link.</p>
<p><strong>What are DHTML events?</strong><br/>
DHTML events are special actions that are provided by the DHTML Object Model. These events can be used in script code to add dynamic content to a Web site. For more information about DHTML events, see the product documentation.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could save code of their choice to the user's local file system. Although this code could not be run through this vulnerability directly, the operating system might open the file if it is saved to a sensitive location, or a user may open the file inadvertently and cause the attacker's code to run.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the <strong>Security</strong> tab and the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security level for the Internet zone is set to <strong>High</strong>. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), HTML content, and file downloads.</li>
<li>Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.</li>
<li>Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.</li>
<li>Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates some drag and drop events. The update also includes a list of valid file types that Internet Explorer will allow drag and drop events on.</p>
<p><strong>Can I add or remove file types to this list of allowed file types?</strong><br/>
Yes. You can allow Internet Explorer drag and drop events on other file types. You can also further restrict what file types you want Internet Explorer to allow drag and drop events on. To do this, edit the following registry key.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> When you do this, be very selective and allow only file types that you must.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.</p>
<p>To allow drag and drop of additional file types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>Regedit</strong> in the <strong>Open</strong> box, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\AllowedDragImageExts</li>
<li>On the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, point to <strong>New</strong>, and then click <strong>DWORD Value</strong>.</li>
<li>Type the file extension, for instance, <strong>.aif</strong>, and then press ENTER.</li>
<li>Right-click the newly created <strong>DWORD value</strong>, change the <strong>Value Data</strong> field to 1, and then press ENTER.
<strong>Note</strong> The Value Data field of a newly created registry value is by default 0 (zero).</li>
</ol>
<p>To disallow drag and drop of certain file types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>Regedit</strong> in the <strong>Open</strong> box, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\AllowedDragImageExts</li>
<li>Remove <strong>DWORD Value</strong> for which you do not wish to allow Internet Explorer drag and drop functionality.
<strong>Note</strong> It is recommended that you back up this registry key before performing this operation.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="url-decoding-zone-spoofing-vulnerability---can-2005-0054">URL Decoding Zone Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0054</h4>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles certain encoded URLs. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious URL. This malicious URL could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. The URL could be made to look like a link to another Web site in an attempt to trick a user into clicking it. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Microsoft Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone.

<h4 id="workarounds-for-url-decoding-zone-spoofing-vulnerability---can-2005-0054">Workarounds for URL Decoding Zone Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0054:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.</strong><br/>
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Install the update that is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.</strong><br/>
Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed.</p>
<p>Customers who use one or more of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.</strong><br/>
Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.</p>
<p>Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594</a>.</p>
<p>For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.</li>
<li>Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.</li>
<li>Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.</li>

<h4 id="faq-for-url-decoding-zone-spoofing-vulnerability---can-2005-0054">FAQ for URL Decoding Zone Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0054:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability could potentially allow remote code execution. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Other possible attack scenarios include cross site scripting and partial address bar spoofing.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The way that Internet Explorer parses certain types of encoded URLs.</p>
<p><strong>What is URL encoding and what it is used for?</strong><br/>
URL encoding is necessary in certain situations where a URL contains characters other than alphanumeric. Characters such as ASCII control characters or other reserved characters are included in a URL without first being encoded might be interpreted in an unintended way by browsers. Some characters, such as “space”, the pound character (“#”), or the percent character (“%”) may be misunderstood if included in URLs and are therefore encoded. For more information about URL encoding, see the Uniform Resource Locators (URL) RFC document: <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt" data-linktype="external">RFC 1738</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause Internet Explorer to interpret an HTML page in the Internet zone as if it were in another Internet Explorer security zone. Internet Explorer would then apply the security settings for that Internet Explorer security zone to the HTML page instead of the Internet Explorer security zone that the HTML page belongs to. A user would have to click a link for any malicious action to occur. This vulnerability could also be used to attempt cross site scripting attacks or partial address bar spoofing. An attacker could create a Web page that would display a URL of the attacker’s choice in the Address bar, while displaying a different Web site in the browser window. An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a malicious page that spoofs a legitimate site. For example, an attacker could create a Web page that looks like a user's online e-mail Web site. However, this Web page would be hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker could use this vulnerability to display a legitimate-looking URL in the Address bar. A user might see this URL and mistakenly provide sensitive information to the attacker's Web site.</p>
<p>The address bar spoof in this case is not complete and would, in part, display the attacker’s Web site URL as well.</p>
<p><strong>What are Internet Explorer security zones?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/174360" data-linktype="external">security zones</a> are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones that are based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much you trust the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by one or more of the vulnerabilities that are addressed in this security bulletin?</strong><br/>

<h4 id="workarounds-for-dhtml-method-heap-memory-corruption-vulnerability---can-2005-0055">Workarounds for DHTML Method Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0055:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running Active Scripting in these zones.</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can change your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting only. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings,</strong> in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. Prompting before running Active Scripting controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.</strong><br/>
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone.

<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks).

<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-channel-definition-format-cdf-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2005-0056">Mitigating Factors for Channel Definition Format (CDF) Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0056:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could also attempt to compromise a Web site to have it display a Web page with malicious content. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site or to a site that has been compromised by the attacker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Microsoft Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms04-018" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040" data-linktype="external">MS03-040</a> or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or a later version in its default configuration, or use Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or a later version in its default configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a security enhancement known as the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/productinfo/xpsp2/securebrowsing/locallockdown.aspx" data-linktype="external">Local Machine zone lockdown.</a> This security enhancement mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Local Machine zone lockdown.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a new security context on all scriptable objects so that access to cached objects (except for ActiveX controls) is blocked. In addition to blocking access when navigating across domains, access is also blocked when navigating within the same domain. In this context, a domain is defined as a fully qualified domain name, or FQDN. A reference to an object is no longer accessible after the context has changed due to navigation.

<h4 id="workarounds-for-channel-definition-format-cdf-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2005-0056">Workarounds for Channel Definition Format (CDF) Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0056:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in these zones.</strong><br/>
You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the high security setting.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can change you settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls only. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings,</strong> in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins,</strong> click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites.</strong><br/>
After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. One in particular that you may want to add is &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks). This is the site that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Install the update that is described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-018 if you are using Outlook Express 5.5 SP2.</strong><br/>
Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed.</p>
<p>Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or a later version, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or a later version, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.</strong><br/>
Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.</p>
<p>Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about enabling this setting in Outlook 2002, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594</a>.</p>
<p>For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.</li>
<li>Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.</li>
<li>Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="faq-for-channel-definition-format-cdf-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2005-0056">FAQ for Channel Definition Format (CDF) Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2005-0056:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a cross-domain vulnerability that could allow information disclosure or remote code execution. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The process by which certain URLs that are found in Channel Definition Format (CDF) files are validated by the Internet Explorer cross-domain security model.</p>
<p><strong>What are Channel Definition Format files?</strong><br/>
Channel Definition Format (CDF) files can be used to organize a set of related Web pages into a logical hierarchy. A channel is a Web site described by a Channel Definition Format (CDF) file. The CDF file defines a hierarchy of the pages that are included in the channel. Besides defining the resources in the channel, the CDF file also specifies how each item will be used or displayed, and when the channel should be updated. For more information about CDF files, see the product documentation.</p>
<p><strong>What are Internet Explorer security zones?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360" data-linktype="external">security zones</a> are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones, based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is put in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then persuading the user to visit this page or to view the HTML e-mail message. When the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message and interacted with the Web page or HTML email message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, local files on the system, or cause script to run in the security context of the Local Machine zone.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user view a Web site for malicious action to occur and accept a prompt for adding an Internet Explorer favorite to their system. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerabilitiy?</strong><br/>
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the <strong>Security</strong> tab and the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security level for the Internet zone is set to <strong>High</strong>. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), HTML content, and file downloads.</li>
<li>Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.</li>
<li>Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.</li>
<li>Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer on Windows XP Service Pack 2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. Windows XP Service Pack 2 introduced a security enhancement known as the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/security/productinfo/xpsp2/securebrowsing/locallockdown.aspx" data-linktype="external">Local Machine zone lockdown</a> that mitigates this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Local Machine zone lockdown?</strong><br/>
In Windows XP Service Pack 2, all local files and content that are processed by Internet Explorer has additional security applied to it in the Local Machine zone. This feature restricts HTML in the Local Machine zone. This feature also restricts HTML that is hosted in Internet Explorer. These restrictions help mitigate attacks where the Local Machine zone is used as an attack vector to load malicious HTML code.</p>
<p>Because of this change, ActiveX script in local HTML pages that are viewed inside Internet Explorer will not run. Also, script in local HTML pages that is viewed inside Internet Explorer prompts the user for permission to run.</p>
<p><strong>Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by making sure that the Internet Explorer cross-domain security model is enforced when Internet Explorer uses Channel Definition Format (CDF) files.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number CAN-2005-0056.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update an affected file, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.</p>
<p>For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by confirming that an <strong>Installed</strong> DWORD value with a data value of 1 exists in the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB867282-ie6sp1-20050127.163319</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 867282 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong><br/>
To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong><br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong><br/>
You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by confirming that <strong>Installed</strong> DWORD value with a data value of 1 exists in the following registry keys.</p>
<p>Windows 2000 SP3: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB867282-ie501sp3-20050107.164329</p>
<p>Windows 2000 SP4: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB867282-ie501sp4-20050107.164742</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 867282 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>

<p><strong>Software Update Services:</strong></p>
<p>By using Microsoft Software Update Services (SUS), administrators can quickly and reliably deploy the latest critical updates and security updates to Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003-based servers, and to desktop systems that are running Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP Professional.</p>
<p>For more information about how to deploy this security update by using Software Update Services, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21133" data-linktype="external">Software Update Services Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Management Server:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack</a> and in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161" data-linktype="external">SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack</a>) to install these updates.</p>
