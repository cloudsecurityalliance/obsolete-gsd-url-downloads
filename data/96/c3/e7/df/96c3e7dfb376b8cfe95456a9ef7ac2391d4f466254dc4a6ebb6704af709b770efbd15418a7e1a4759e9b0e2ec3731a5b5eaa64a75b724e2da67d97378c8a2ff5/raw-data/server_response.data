<BR>
Original Release Date:  August 22, 2012<BR>
Last Revised: October 16, 2013<BR>
Number:  ASA-2012-344<BR>

<H2>1. Overview:</H2>
<P>The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux 
operating system.</P>
<P>The fix for CVE-2011-1083 (RHSA-2012:0150) introduced a flaw in the way the 
Linux kernel's Event Poll (epoll) subsystem handled resource clean up when an 
ELOOP error code was returned. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw 
to cause a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project 
(cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name 
<A HREF="https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2012-3375.html">
CVE-2012-3375</A> to this issue.</P>
</P>
<P>More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:</P>

<P><B>Recommended Actions for System Products:</B><BR>Avaya strongly 
recommends that customers follow networking and security best practices by 
implementing firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate access 
restrictions. Though Avaya believes such restrictions should always be in 
place, risk to Avaya products and the surrounding network from this potential 
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these practices are implemented 
until such time as an Avaya provided product update or the recommended Avaya 
action is applied. Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the 
customer's security policies may be required during this interim period, but 
customers should not modify the System Product operating system or application 
unless the change is approved by Avaya. Making changes that are not approved 
may void the Avaya product service contract.</P>

<H3>Mitigating Factors:</H3>
<P>When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as 
outlined by Avaya's 
<A HREF="https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674">
Security Vulnerability Classification Policy</A>. 
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific 
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:</P>

<H2>3. Avaya Software-Only Products:</H2>
<P>Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems. 
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or 
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not 
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the 
underlying platform.</P>
<P>In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the 
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should 
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow 
that vendor's guidance.</P>
