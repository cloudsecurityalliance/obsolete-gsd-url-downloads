<p>The software in this list has been tested to determine if the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected.

<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This update resolves several newly discovered publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in this bulletin in its own Vulnerability Details section.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>Microsoft recommends that customers install the update immediately.</p>

<p><strong>I am still using Windows XP, but extended security update support ended on September 30th, 2004. However, this bulletin has a security update for this operating system version. Why is that?</strong></p>
<p>The original version of Windows XP, commonly referred to as Windows XP Gold or Windows XP Release to Manufacturing (RTM) version, reached the end of its extended security update support life cycle on September 30th, 2004. However, the end-of-life occurred very recently. In this case, the majority of the steps that are required to address this vulnerability were completed before this date. Therefore, we have decided to release a security update for this operating system version as part of this security bulletin. We do not anticipate doing this for future vulnerabilities affecting this operating system version, but we reserve the right to produce updates and to make these updates available when necessary. It should be a priority for customers who have this operating system version to migrate to supported operating system versions to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

<p><strong>Why are the command line installation switches different for the Internet Explorer 5.01 and Internet Explorer 6, and Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 packages on Windows 2000 and Windows XP operating systems for this release when compared to the last Internet Explorer Cumulative Security Update, MS04-025?</strong><br/>
These packages listed above are using a new installation technology, Update.exe. As a result the installation options are different than in previous releases. Also, as part of the change to the Update.exe installation technology the Knowledge Base Article number of this update will no longer be display in the Help, About window for Internet Explorer. For more information on the command line switches used for these release, please reference the Security Update Information section of this bulletin. More information on Update.exe is located on the following <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/deployment/winupdte.mspx" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Web Site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why are there two versions of the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 update?</strong><br/>
A separate package has been created for Internet Explore 6 Service Pack 1 when used on Windows NT Server Service Pack 6a, Windows 98, Windows 98SE, and Windows Me. This update uses the same installer technology as previous releases, Iexpress. For details on installing this security update on those operating systems please see the Security Update Information sections of this bulletin. More information on Iexpress is located on the following <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=197147" data-linktype="external">Web Site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) to determine if this update is required?</strong><br/>
Yes. MBSA will determine if this update is require. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">MBSA Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> After April 20, 2004, the Mssecure.xml file that is used by MBSA 1.1.1 and earlier versions is no longer being updated with new security bulletin data. Therefore, scans that are performed after that date with MBSA 1.1.1 or earlier will be incomplete. All users should upgrade to MBSA 1.2 because it provides more accurate security update detection and supports additional products. Users can download MBSA 1.2 from the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">MBSA Web site</a>. For more information about MBSA support, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33332" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer 1.2 Q&amp;A Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use Systems Management Server (SMS) to determine if this update is required?</strong><br/>
SMS can successfully deploy this update for all versions of Internet Explorer, except for Internet Explorer 6 SP1. As noted in the Affected Components section of this bulletin, this release includes two packages for Internet Explorer 6 SP1. One package is designed for Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows XPSP1. This package uses the Update.exe installation technology discussed above. The second package is designed for Windows NT, Windows 98, and Windows Me. MBSA is not able to determine which Internet Explorer 6 SP1 update is required for a specific Operating System. A package intended for SMS Deployment only has been created that contains both versions of the Internet Explorer 6 SP1 updates. When deployed with SMS, this package will detect the operating system and install the correct version of the update for that operating system. MBSA when used with SMS, will instruct SMS administrators to deploy this SMS Deployment package. For more information on this update, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=887437" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 887437.</a></p>
<p><strong>I am running Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate any of these vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration that mitigates many Internet Explorer vulnerabilities. Since this Security Bulletin addresses multiple vulnerabilities, this mitigation is specified in the Mitigating Factors section of the respective vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What is Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying numerous security-related settings, including the settings on the <strong>Security</strong> and the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box. Some of the important modifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security level for the Internet zone is set to High. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), HTML content, and file downloads.</li>
<li>Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.</li>
<li>Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.</li>
<li>Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vulnerability-details">Vulnerability Details</h2>
<h4 id="css-heap-memory-corruption-vulnerability---can-2004-0842">CSS Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0842:</h4>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web Page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. However, significant user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-css-heap-memory-corruption-vulnerability---can-2004-0842">Mitigating Factors for CSS Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0842:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would be prompted to perform several actions. An attack could only occur after they performed these actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The risk of attack from the HTML e-mail vector can be significantly reduced if you meet all the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms03-040" data-linktype="external">MS03-040</a> or a later Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer.</li>
<li>Use Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 or later and have applied the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> or a later Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express.</li>
<li>Use Microsoft Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 with the Microsoft Outlook E-mail Security Update installed</li>
<li>Use Microsoft Outlook Express 6 or later or Microsoft Outlook 2000 Service Pack 2 or later in their default configuration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The following products are not affected by this vulnerability.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP Service Pack 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-css-heap-memory-corruption-vulnerability---can-2004-0842">Workarounds for CSS Heap Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0842:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX control and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone.</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and click <strong>Custom Level.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Active Scripting</strong> in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Active Scripting</strong> in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, , click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong>to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. Microsoft recommends that you only add sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>

<h4 id="workarounds-for-similar-method-name-redirection-cross-domain-vulnerability---can-2004-0727">Workarounds for Similar Method Name Redirection Cross Domain Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0727:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Set Internet and Local Intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone.</strong></p>
<p>You can help protect against these vulnerabilities by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active scripting. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level.</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Active Scripting</strong> in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Active Scripting</strong> in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.</p>
<p>Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong>to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. If you do this, you can continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. You may want to add &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks) to your Trusted Sites zone. This site hosts the update. This site uses an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Strengthen the security settings for the Local Machine zone in Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>Because this vulnerability permits an attacker to run HTML code in the Local Machine security zone, users can reduce the impact of this vulnerability by restricting the default settings in this zone. For more information about these settings, and for more information about the potential impacts of changing these default settings, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=833633" data-linktype="external">833633</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers consider these changes to Internet Explorer security settings as a last resort only. If you make these changes, you may lose some functionality for some Windows programs and components. Before you make these changes in a production environment, test the changes extensively to verify that mission-critical programs continue to work correctly for all users.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Install the</strong> <strong>Outlook E-mail Security Update</strong> <strong>if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.</strong></p>
<p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied.</p>
<p>Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.</p>

<p>Customers who use any of these products could be at a reduced risk from an e-mail-borne attack that tries to exploit this vulnerability unless the user clicks a malicious link in the e-mail message.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Read e-mail messages in plain text format if you are using Outlook 2002 or later, or Outlook Express 6 SP1 or later, to help protect yourself from the HTML e-mail attack vector.</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or later and Microsoft Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.</p>
<p>Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats.

A vulnerability in the cross domain security model exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles navigation methods by functions that have similar names. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer or access information in a different domain. In the worst case, if a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The process that the Internet Explorer cross-domain security model uses to validate navigation methods that have similar function names.</p>
<p><strong>What is the cross-domain security model that Internet Explorer uses?</strong><br/>
One of the principal security functions of a browser is to make sure that browser windows that are under the control of different Web sites cannot interfere with each other or access each other's data, while allowing windows from the same site to interact with each other. To differentiate between cooperative and uncooperative browser windows, the concept of a &quot;domain&quot; has been created. A domain is a security boundary - any open windows within the same domain can interact with each other, but windows from different domains cannot. The cross-domain security model is the part of the security architecture that keeps windows from different domains from interfering with each other.</p>
<p>The simplest example of a domain is associated with Web sites. If you visit <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a>, and it opens a window to <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com/security" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com/security</a>, the two windows can interact with each other because both sites belong to the same domain, <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a>. However, if you visited <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a>, and it opened a window to a different Web site, the cross-domain security model would protect the two windows from each other. The concept goes even further. The file system on your local computer is also a domain. For example, <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a> could open a window and show you a file on your hard disk. However, because your local file system is in a different domain from the Web site, the cross-domain security model should prevent the Web site from reading the file that is being displayed.</p>
<p>The Internet Explorer cross-domain security model can be configured by using the security zone settings in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>What are Internet Explorer security zones?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer security zones are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones that are based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is placed in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run malicious script code in the Local Machine security zone in Internet Explorer. This could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected system.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then convincing the user to visit this page or to view the HTML e-mail message. When the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other Web sites, access local files on the system, or cause script to run in the security context of the Local Machine security zone.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>

For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.</p>
<p>Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong>to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. If you do this, you can continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. You may want to add &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; (without the quotation marks) to your Trusted Sites zone. This site hosts the update. This site uses an ActiveX control to install the update.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Install the</strong> <strong>Outlook E-mail Security Update</strong> <strong>if you are using Outlook 2000 SP1 or earlier.</strong></p>
<p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-install-engine-vulnerability---can-2004-0216">FAQ for Install Engine Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0216:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. If a user is logged on with administrative privileges, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system, including installing programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full privileges. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An unchecked buffer in the Internet Explorer Install Engine.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Install Engine?</strong><br/>
The Install Engine is part of the Internet Explorer Active Setup technology. Active Setup allows an installation program to receive additional files from the Internet that are needed for program initialization.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious Web page or an HTML e-mail message and then enticing the user to visit this page or to view the HTML e-mail message. When the user visited the page or viewed the e-mail message, the attacker could access information from other websites, local files on the system, or cause malicious code to run in the security context of the locally logged on user.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Yes. Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition are critically affected by this vulnerability.

<p>A<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21142" data-linktype="external">privilege elevation</a> vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that Internet Explorer handles Drag and Drop events. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow an attacker to save a file on the user’s system if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a malicious e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-drag-and-drop-vulnerability---can-2004-0839">Mitigating Factors for Drag and Drop Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0839:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site. After they click the link, they would need to perform an action on the malicious web site that would invoke drag-and-drop handling in Internet Explorer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This vulnerability allows an attacker to place malicious code on the user’s system in specified locations. An attack could only occur after the user ran this code, either by restarting the system, by logging off and then logging back on to the system, or by inadvertently running the code that the attacker saved locally on the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same privileges as the user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer privileges on the system would be at less risk than users who operate with administrative privileges.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally, Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the Outlook E-mail Security Update has been applied. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail in the Restricted sites zone if the update that is included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been applied.

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a spoofing vulnerability. It affects the Address bar that Internet Explorer uses to display the currently visited Web site. This vulnerability could result in an incorrect URL being listed in the Address bar that is not the actual Web page that is appearing in Internet Explorer. For example, an attacker could create a link that would display <strong><a href="http://www.tailspintoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.tailspintoys.com</a></strong> in the Address bar when the user clicked the link. However, Internet Explorer would actually display content from another Web site, such as <strong><a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability is caused by a canonicalization error that occurs when Internet Explorer parses special characters in a HTTP URL on Double Byte Character Set systems.</p>
<p><strong>What are Double Byte Character Sets?</strong><br/>
Double Byte Character Sets (DBCS) are an expanded 8-bit character set where the smallest unit is a byte. Some characters in a DBCS have a single byte code value and some have a double byte code value. A DBCS can be thought of as the ANSI character set for some Asian versions of Microsoft Windows. More information on DBCS can be found on the Double-byte Character Sets page on MSDN.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if I am running a DBCS locale?</strong><br/>
DBCS can be thought of as the ANSI character set for some Asian versions of Microsoft Windows. Typically these are limited to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. For more information on system locales and determining the system locale please visit this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/drintl/faqs/locales.mspx" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Web site.</a></p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a Web page that would display a URL of the attacker's choosing in the Address bar, while displaying a different Web site in the browser window. An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a malicious page that spoofs a legitimate site. For example, an attacker could create a Web page that looks like a user's online e-mail site. However, this Web page would be hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker could use this vulnerability to display a legitimate looking URL in the Address bar. A user might see this URL and mistakenly provide sensitive information to the attacker's site.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

<li>Under <strong>Active Scripting</strong> in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, click <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements.</p>
<p>Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong>to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the &quot;Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites&quot; workaround.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Restrict Web sites to only your trusted Web sites</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local Intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. If you do this, you can continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>

<h4 id="faq-for-plug-in-navigation-address-bar-spoofing-vulnerability---can-2004-0843">FAQ for Plug-in Navigation Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0843:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a spoofing vulnerability. It affects the Address bar that Internet Explorer uses to display the currently visited Web site. This vulnerability could result in an incorrect URL being listed in the Address bar that is not the actual Web page that is appearing in Internet Explorer. For example, an attacker could create a link that would display <strong><a href="http://www.tailspintoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.tailspintoys.com</a></strong> in the Address bar when the user clicked the link. However, Internet Explorer would actually display content from another Web site, such as <strong><a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com" data-linktype="external">http://www.wingtiptoys.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The way that Internet Explorer handles navigations from plug-ins.</p>
<p><strong>What are plug-ins?</strong><br/>
Plug-ins are third-party components that extend the features of Internet Explorer. Examples of plug-ins include ActiveX controls.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a Web page that hosts a plug-in that could make Internet Explorer display a URL of the attacker's choosing in the Address bar, while displaying a different Web site in the browser window. An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a malicious page that spoofs a legitimate site. For example, an attacker could create a Web page that looks like a user's online e-mail site. However, this Web page would be hosted on a malicious Web site. An attacker could use this vulnerability to display a legitimate looking URL in the Address bar. A user might see this URL and mistakenly provide sensitive information to the attacker's site.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to read e-mail or to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>Are Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition or Windows Millennium Edition critically affected by this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
No. Although Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, and Windows Millennium Edition do contain the affected component, the vulnerability is not critical. For more information about severity ratings, visit this <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21140" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer validates plug-in navigations.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is an information disclosure and spoofing vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain access to information or spoof content on SSL protected Web sites.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer’s handling of cached SSL contents.</p>
<p><strong>What is SSL?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2246.txt" data-linktype="external">Secure Sockets Layer</a> (SSL) is a protocol that allows web sessions to be encrypted for greater security. In Internet Explorer, when you visit a Web site and a yellow lock icon appears in the lower right corner of the browser window, the current session is protected by SSL.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could access information or spoof content on Web sites that are protected by SSL.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a Web site that has the same host name as a legitimate SSL protected Web site. If the attacker were then able to redirect navigation from the legitimate Web Site at that address to their malicious Web site, items of the attacker’s choosing could be cached to the local system.</p>
<p>When the user visited the legitimate site in a second session, these items would be loaded in the context of the legitimate Web site. These items could include script code, images, or other locally cached content. This content could be crafted to obtain sensitive information that would typically be protected by SSL security.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and to be reading e-mail or visiting Web sites for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail is read or where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as users’ workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

<p><strong>Note</strong> When you install this security update on Windows Server 2003 or on Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003, the installer checks to see if any of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix. If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR files to your system.

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update is installed on an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. This tool allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results pane</strong>, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name box</strong>, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by confirming that Installed DWORD value with a data value of 1 exists in the following registry keys.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\KB834707-ie6sp1-20040929.091901</p>

<p>/<strong>R:N</strong> Never restarts the computer after installation.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:I</strong> Prompts the user to restart the computer if a restart is required, except when used with <strong>/Q:A</strong>.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:A</strong> Always restarts the computer after installation.</p>
<p>/<strong>R:S</strong> Restarts the computer after installation without prompting the user.</p>
<p>/<strong>N:V</strong> No version checking - Install the program over any previous version.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> These switches do not necessarily work with all updates. If a switch is not available, then that functionality is necessary for the correct installation of the update. Also, the use of the /N:V switch is unsupported and may result in an unbootable system. If the installation is unsuccessful, you should consult your support professional to understand why it failed to install.</p>

<p><strong>Verifying Update Installation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results pane</strong>, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name box</strong>, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying the update installation. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\{3e7bb08a-a7a3-4692-8eac-ac5e7895755b}</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Confirm that the <strong>IsInstalled</strong> DWORD value with a data value of 1 appears in the registry key.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Program Version Verification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Confirm that <strong>Q834707</strong> is listed in the <strong>Update Versions</strong> field in the <strong>About Internet Explorer</strong> dialog box</p>
<h4 id="internet-explorer-501-for-windows-2000-all-versions">Internet Explorer 5.01 for Windows 2000 (all versions)</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br/>

<p><strong>Systems Management Server:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and to perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer and the Microsoft Office Detection Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, see the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack</a> and in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161" data-linktype="external">SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack</a>) to install these updates.</p>
