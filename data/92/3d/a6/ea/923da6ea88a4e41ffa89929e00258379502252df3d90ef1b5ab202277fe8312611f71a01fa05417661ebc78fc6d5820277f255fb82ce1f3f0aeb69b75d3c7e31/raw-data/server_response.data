<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-office-could-allow-remote-code-execution-2423930">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2423930)</h2>
<p>Published: November 09, 2010 | Updated: April 12, 2011</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and five privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens or previews a specially crafted RTF e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010. This security update is also rated Important for all supported editions of Microsoft Office XP, Microsoft Office 2003, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Microsoft Office for Mac 2011; and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office software parses files and by helping to ensure a vulnerable component of Microsoft Office uses a more appropriate and secure search order when loading libraries. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2423930" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2423930</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>

Microsoft revised this bulletin to add <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-2573" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-2573</a> to the vulnerabilities addressed by this update. For Microsoft PowerPoint 2002 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2003, CVE-2010-2573 is also addressed by the Microsoft Office update provided in this bulletin (MS10-087). This is an informational change only. Customers who have already successfully applied the MS10-087 and the MS10-088 updates do not need to take any action.</p>
<p><strong>Where is the update for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac?</strong><br/>
The Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2505924) update offered in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210121" data-linktype="external">MS11-021</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210727" data-linktype="external">MS11-022</a>, and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210206" data-linktype="external">MS11-023</a> security bulletins also addresses the vulnerabilities described in this security bulletin in addition to the vulnerabilities described in the respective bulletins. Although the KB2505924 update package is offered in three separate security bulletins, users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac installed will only need to install the security update package once. See <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210121" data-linktype="external">MS11-021</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210727" data-linktype="external">MS11-022</a>, or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210206" data-linktype="external">MS11-023</a> for more information and download links.</p>
<p><strong>How does MS10-088 relate to this bulletin (MS10-087)?</strong><br/>
<a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-2573" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-2573</a> is addressed in both this bulletin (MS10-087) and in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=198186" data-linktype="external">MS10-088</a>, Vulnerabilities in Microsoft PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2293386). For Microsoft PowerPoint 2002 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2003, this update (MS10-087) addresses the vulnerability. MS10-088 addresses all other software, including PowerPoint viewers, affected by CVE-2010-2573.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
Refer to the reference tables in the <strong>Security Update Deployment</strong> section for the location of the file information details.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>How is Microsoft Office Outlook affected by these vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
Outlook is not directly affected because the vulnerabilities can only be exploited through Microsoft Word. If Word is the selected e-mail reader, which is the default setting in Microsoft Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Outlook 2010, then an attacker could leverage Outlook for the e-mail attack vector by sending a specially crafted RTF e-mail message to the target user. In this scenario this attack vector requires minimal user action (as in viewing a specially crafted e-mail through the preview pane in Outlook) to be exploited.</p>
<p><strong>How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Word is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of the affected Microsoft Office Suite.</p>
<p><strong>I have a non-vulnerable version of software installed, why am I being offered this update?</strong><br/>
Some non-affected software, including Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats, Microsoft Word Viewer, Microsoft Excel Viewer, and Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer, contain the vulnerable shared component of Microsoft Office, but because they do not access the vulnerable code, they are not affected by this vulnerability. However, since the vulnerable code is present, this update will be offered.</p>
<p><strong>Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?</strong><br/>
No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle.

<h2 id="powerpoint-integer-underflow-causes-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2010-2573">PowerPoint Integer Underflow Causes Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2573</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-2573" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-2573</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-powerpoint-integer-underflow-causes-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2010-2573">Mitigating Factors for PowerPoint Integer Underflow Causes Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2573</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-powerpoint-integer-underflow-causes-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2010-2573">Workarounds for PowerPoint Integer Underflow Causes Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2573</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>For Office 2003</strong> </p>
<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Microsoft Office 2003, all of the latest security updates for Microsoft Office 2003 must be applied.</p>
<p>Alternatively, file block can be applied using Group Policy. For more information, see the TechNet article, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc179230.aspx" data-linktype="external">Plan file block settings for Office 2010</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> For Microsoft Office 2003 and Microsoft Office 2007, users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special &quot;exempt directory&quot; as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions. For Microsoft Office 2007, Office 2003 or earlier versions will either be blocked from opening or will be opened in protected mode depending on the open behavior that was selected.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong></p>
<p>For Office 2003</p>
<pre><code>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
</code></pre>
<pre><code>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]
</code></pre>
<pre><code>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Download Center</a>.</p>
<p>MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit <a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Update</a> to install all recommended updates.</p>
<p><strong>Enable MOICE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865</a> to use the automated <strong>Microsoft Fix it</strong> solution to enable or disable this workaround.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-powerpoint-integer-underflow-causes-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2010-2573">FAQ for PowerPoint Integer Underflow Causes Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-2573</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs or view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability exists because of the way that Microsoft PowerPoint parses the PowerPoint file format when opening a specially crafted PowerPoint file.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability exists because of the way that Microsoft PowerPoint parses the PowerPoint file format when opening a specially crafted PowerPoint file.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted PowerPoint file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a PowerPoint file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>

<h2 id="rtf-stack-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3333">RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3333</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that affected Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted Rich Text Format (RTF) data. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>

<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-rtf-stack-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3333">Mitigating Factors for RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3333</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability.

<h4 id="workarounds-for-rtf-stack-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3333">Workarounds for RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3333</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Read e-mails in plain text</strong></p>
<p>To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view in plain text only those e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted.</p>
<p>Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.</li>
<li>Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.</li>
<li>Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of RTF documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-rtf-stack-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3333">FAQ for RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3333</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted RTF-formatted data, system memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What is RTF?</strong><br/>
Rich Text Format (RTF) is a method of encoding formatted text and graphics for use within applications and for transfer between applications. Users often depend on special translation software to move word-processing documents between various applications developed by different companies. RTF serves as both a standard of data transfer between word processing software, document formatting, and a means of migrating content from one operating system to another.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause arbitrary code to run with the privileges of the user who opens a specially crafted RTF file or previews or opens a specially crafted RTF e-mail message. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open or preview specially crafted RTF-formatted data with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially-crafted RTF-formatted data in the contents of an e-mail message. The vulnerability could be exploited when the specially crafted RTF e-mail message is previewed or opened in Outlook while using Word as the e-mail viewer. An attacker could also exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted RTF file as an attachment and convincing the user to open the specially crafted RTF file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.</p>
<p><strong>How is Microsoft Office affected by this vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Although the known attack vectors can only leverage Microsoft Word, the vulnerable code exists in a shared component of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Office software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office parses RTF-formatted data.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="office-art-drawing-records-vulnerability---cve-2010-3334">Office Art Drawing Records Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3334</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office software parses specially crafted Office files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-3334" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-3334</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-office-art-drawing-records-vulnerability---cve-2010-3334">Mitigating Factors for Office Art Drawing Records Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3334</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-office-art-drawing-records-vulnerability---cve-2010-3334">Workarounds for Office Art Drawing Records Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3334</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents in Microsoft Word from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>

When a user opens a specially crafted Office file, system memory may become corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Office file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Office software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office software parses files.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When a user opens a specially crafted Office file, system memory may become corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Office file with an affected version of Microsoft Office software.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office file to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains an Office file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Systems where Microsoft Office software is used, including workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office parses files.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="insecure-library-loading-vulnerability---cve-2010-3337">Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3337</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-3337" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-3337</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-insecure-library-loading-vulnerability---cve-2010-3337">Mitigating Factors for Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3337</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>For an attack to be successful using an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share, a user must be convinced to open a PowerPoint presentation located on the remote file system location or WebDAV share. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share.</li>
<li>The file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-insecure-library-loading-vulnerability---cve-2010-3337">Workarounds for Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3337</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107</a> to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.</p>
<p>Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107</a> to use the automated <strong>Microsoft Fix it</strong> solution to deploy the registry key to block loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107</a> first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Disable the WebClient service</strong></p>
<p>Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause Microsoft Office Outlook to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.</p>
<p>To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>Services.msc</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click <strong>WebClient</strong> service and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the Startup type to <strong>Disabled</strong>. If the service is running, click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and exit the management application.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.</p>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong></p>
<p>To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>Services.msc</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Right-click <strong>WebClient</strong> service and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Change the Startup type to <strong>Automatic</strong>. If the service is not running, click <strong>Start</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> and exit the management application.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall</strong></p>
<p>These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312" data-linktype="external">TCP and UDP Port Assignments</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of workaround.</strong> Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications that use SMB (CIFS)</li>
<li>Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)</li>
<li>Server (File and Print Sharing)</li>
<li>Group Policy</li>
<li>Net Logon</li>
<li>Distributed File System (DFS)</li>
<li>Terminal Server Licensing</li>
<li>Print Spooler</li>
<li>Computer Browser</li>
<li>Remote Procedure Call Locator</li>
<li>Fax Service</li>
<li>Indexing Service</li>
<li>Performance Logs and Alerts</li>
<li>Systems Management Server</li>
<li>License Logging Service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How to undo the workaround.</strong> Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312" data-linktype="external">TCP and UDP Port Assignments</a>.</p>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch                    | Description                                                                                                         |  
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?** or **/help**       | Displays usage dialog.                                                                                              |  
| **/passive**              | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel.           |  
| **/quiet**                | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/norestart**            | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart.                                                  |  
| **/forcerestart**         | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |  
| **/extract**              | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder.                                   |  
| **/extract:&lt;path&gt;** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/lang:&lt;LCID&gt;**    | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language.                              |  
| **/log:&lt;log file&gt;** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation.                                        |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
