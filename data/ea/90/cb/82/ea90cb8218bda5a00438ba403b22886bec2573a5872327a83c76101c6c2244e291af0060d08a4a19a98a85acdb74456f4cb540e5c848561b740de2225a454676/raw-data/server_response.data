<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-office-powerpoint-could-allow-remote-code-execution-967340">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution (967340)</h2>
<p>Published: May 12, 2009 | Updated: June 09, 2009</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 2.0</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability and several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office PowerPoint that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000. For supported editions of Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003, Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; all supported versions of PowerPoint Viewer, and Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats; Microsoft Works 8.5; and Microsoft Works 9, this security update is rated Important. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that PowerPoint handles conditions that could cause memory corruption when opening specially crafted PowerPoint files. This update also addresses the vulnerabilities by preventing Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 from opening PowerPoint 4.0 native file formats. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p>This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/969136" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 969136</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967340" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967340</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update
----------------------------------------------------------------
<p><strong>Why was this bulletin rereleased on June 9, 2009?</strong>
Microsoft rereleased this security bulletin to provide security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, Open XML File Format Converter for Mac, Microsoft Works 8.5, and Microsoft Works 9. Customers who currently have these software installed need to apply this update immediately.
When this bulletin was first released, these security update packages were still in development. At the time, Microsoft released this bulletin because we had update packages ready on the regular bulletin release cycle for an entire product line to address the vast majority of customers at risk. This current release now completes the range of updates for software that are affected by the vulnerabilities discussed in this bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>MS09-021 and MS09-027 also describe vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. How do MS09-021 and MS09-027 relate to this bulletin (MS09-017)?</strong><br/>
The security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB969661), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB971822), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB971824) in this bulletin, MS09-017, also address the vulnerabilities described in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=147294" data-linktype="external">MS09-021</a> and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=147416" data-linktype="external">MS09-027</a>. Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, or Open XML File Format Converter for Mac installed will only need to install the update packages once.</p>
<p><strong>MS09-024 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Works 8.5 and Microsoft Works 9. How does MS09-024 relate to this bulletin (MS09-017)?</strong><br/>
The security update packages for Microsoft Works 8.5 (KB967043) and Microsoft Works 9 (KB967044) in this bulletin, MS09-017, also address the vulnerabilities described in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=128104" data-linktype="external">MS09-024</a>. Users with Microsoft Works 8.5 or Microsoft Works 9 installed will only need to install the update packages once.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
The file information details can be found in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/967340" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 967340</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Do users need to make special considerations regarding PowerPoint 4.0 file formats?</strong><br/>
With this update, the ability to open PowerPoint 4.0 file formats will be disabled by default in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002. This functionality has already been disabled by default in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3. This functionality also no longer exists in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007. For more information regarding this change, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970980" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970980</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this update Critical for PowerPoint 2000 but only Important for all other affected versions of PowerPoint?</strong><br/>
Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002 and later versions have a built-in feature that prompts a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.</p>
<p><strong>What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?</strong><br/>
The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.</p>
<p><strong>The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?</strong><br/>
Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism</strong> 
No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>
<p>It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>. For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Product Support Services</a>.</p>
<p>Customers who require custom support for older releases must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office.

<h2 id="legacy-file-format-vulnerability---cve-2009-0220">Legacy File Format Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0220</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0220" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-0220</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-legacy-file-format-vulnerability---cve-2009-0220">Mitigating Factors for Legacy File Format Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0220</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 blocks the opening and saving of certain files by default upon installation. For Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3, these are files that are older than PowerPoint 97 and that have file types such as .ppt, .pot, .pps, and .ppa. Notice that this feature does not apply to Microsoft Office PowerPoint 97 files. For more information, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938810" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 938810</a>.</li>
<li>Users who have installed and are using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f" data-linktype="external">Office Document Open Confirmation Tool</a> for Office 2000 will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>This vulnerability does not affect PowerPoint 2007, PowerPoint Viewer 2003, and PowerPoint Viewer 2007.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-legacy-file-format-vulnerability---cve-2009-0220">Workarounds for Legacy File Format Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0220</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Restrict access to pp4x322.dll in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 or Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2002</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> You will need administrator privileges to set these file restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On 32-bit editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following command from a command prompt:</p>
<p>for /F &quot;tokens=*&quot; %G IN ('dir /b /s ^&quot;%programfiles%\Microsoft Office\pp4x322.dll^&quot;') DO cacls &quot;%G&quot; /E /P everyone:N</p>
</li>
<li><p>On 64-bit editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following command from a command prompt:</p>
<p>for /F &quot;tokens=*&quot; %G IN ('dir /b /s ^&quot;%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\pp4x322.dll^&quot;') DO cacls &quot;%G&quot; /E /P everyone:N</p>
</li>
<li><p>On 32-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:</p>
<p>for /F &quot;tokens=*&quot; %G IN ('dir /b /s ^&quot;%programfiles%\Microsoft Office\pp4x322.dll^&quot;') DO cacls &quot;%G&quot; /E /P everyone:N</p>
</li>
<li><p>On 64-bit editions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, run the following command from an elevated command prompt:</p>
<p>for /F &quot;tokens=*&quot; %G IN ('dir /b /s ^&quot;%programfiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\pp4x322.dll^&quot;') DO cacls &quot;%G&quot; /E /P everyone:N</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround.</strong> You will not be able to open PowerPoint 4.0 files.</p>
<p><strong>How to Undo the Workaround:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>On 32-bit editions of Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, run the following command from a command prompt:</p>

<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When PowerPoint reads paragraph formatting data from specially crafted PowerPoint 4.0 files, an error may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system in the context of the current logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted PowerPoint 4.0 file with an affected version of Microsoft Office PowerPoint.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a PowerPoint file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted PowerPoint file, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</p>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3 blocks the opening and saving of certain files by default upon installation. For Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3, these are files that are older than PowerPoint 97 and that have file types such as .ppt, .pot, .pps, and .ppa. Notice that this feature does not apply to Microsoft Office PowerPoint 97 files. For more information, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938810" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 938810</a>.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a PowerPoint file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted PowerPoint file, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-integer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2009-0221">Workarounds for Integer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0221</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now</a></p>
<p>MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:</p>
<p><a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" data-linktype="external">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us</a></p>
<p>To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler</th>
<th>Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show</td>
<td>ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template</td>
<td>ASSOC .pot=PowerPoint.Template.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow</td>
<td>ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note</strong> On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>For more information on MOICE, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Office 2003</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970980" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970980</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.</p>
<p><strong>How to Undo the Workaround:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Office 2003</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.</p>

<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2009-0224">Workarounds for Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0224</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now</a></p>
<p>MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:</p>
<p><a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" data-linktype="external">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us</a></p>
<p>To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler</th>
<th>Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show</td>
<td>ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template</td>
<td>ASSOC .pot=PowerPoint.Template.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow</td>
<td>ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note</strong> On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>For more information on MOICE, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Office 2003</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970980" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970980</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.</p>
<p><strong>How to Undo the Workaround:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Office 2003</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000000</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.</p>

<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now</a></p>
<p>MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:</p>
<p><a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" data-linktype="external">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us</a></p>
<p>To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler</th>
<th>Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler</th>

<td>ASSOC .pot=PowerPoint.Template.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow</td>

<p><strong>Note</strong> On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>For more information on MOICE, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Office 2003</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970980" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970980</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.</p>

<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) will protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or 2007 Office system installed.</p>
<p>To install MOICE, you must have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the Microsoft Download Center:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Download the FileFormatConverters.exe package now</a></p>
<p>MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit Microsoft Update to install all recommended updates:</p>
<p><a href="http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us" data-linktype="external">http://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx?ln=en-us</a></p>
<p>To enable MOICE, change the registered handler for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats. The following table describes the command to enable or to disable MOICE for the .ppt, .pot, and .pps file formats:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Command to use to enable MOICE to be the registered handler</th>
<th>Command to use to disable MOICE as the registered handler</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show</td>
<td>ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template</td>
<td>ASSOC .pot=PowerPoint.Template.8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow</td>
<td>ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note</strong> On Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the commands above will need to be run from an elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>For more information on MOICE, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the 2007 Microsoft Office System Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations</strong></p>
<p>The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For Office 2003</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\11.0\PowerPoint\Security\FileOpenBlock]</p>
<p>&quot;BinaryFiles&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates must be applied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970980" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 970980</a> will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.</p>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When PowerPoint reads sound data from specially crafted PowerPoint 4.0 files, an error may corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system in the context of the current logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted PowerPoint 4.0 file with an affected version of Microsoft Office PowerPoint.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a PowerPoint file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted PowerPoint file, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convincing them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.</p>

For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
After you install the update, you cannot remove it. To revert to an installation before the update was installed; you must remove the application, and then install it again from the original media.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Office, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system.

| **/passive**              | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel.           |  
| **/quiet**                | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/norestart**            | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart.                                                  |  
| **/forcerestart**         | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |  
| **/extract**              | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder.                                   |  
| **/extract:&lt;path&gt;** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/lang:&lt;LCID&gt;**    | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language.                              |  
| **/log:&lt;log file&gt;** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation.                                        |
