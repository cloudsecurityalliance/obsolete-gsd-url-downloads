<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-active-template-library-atl-activex-controls-for-microsoft-office-could-allow-remote-code-execution-973965">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) ActiveX Controls for Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (973965)</h2>
<p>Published: October 13, 2009 | Updated: February 17, 2010</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.5</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in ActiveX Controls for Microsoft Office that were compiled with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL). The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user loaded a specially crafted component or control. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Outlook 2002, Microsoft Office Outlook 2003, Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, Microsoft Visio 2002 Viewer, Microsoft Office Visio 2003 Viewer, and Microsoft Office Visio Viewer 2007. For more information on the software affected by this update, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting the manner in which ATL handles the instantiation of objects from data streams, providing updated versions of the affected components and controls built using corrected ATL headers. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973965" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 973965</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why was this bulletin revised on February 9, 2010?</strong><br/>
Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce a detection logic change to fix the issue where the July 8, 2008 update for Outlook 2003 (KB953432) was incorrectly being offered in addition to the update package for Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 Service Pack 3 (KB973705). This is a deployment change only that does not affect the files contained in the initial update. Customers who have successfully updated their systems do not need to reinstall this update.</p>
<p><strong>Why was this bulletin revised on January 12, 2010?</strong><br/>
Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce a detection logic change to fix the issue where the June 9, 2009 update for Outlook 2007 (KB969907) was incorrectly being offered in addition to the update package for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 2 (KB972363). Update KB972363 replaces update KB969907. This is a deployment change only that does not affect the files contained in the initial update. Customers who have successfully updated their systems do not need to reinstall this update.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any non-security related changes to functionality?</strong><br/>
Yes, the update package for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 and Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 Service Pack 2 (KB972363) includes the changes to Outlook 2007 described in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969907" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 969907</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why are KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 not listed in this security bulletin?</strong><br/>
The update associated with Microsoft Knowledge Base articles 974554, 974556, and 974234 is not a security update and does not correct any security-related issues. However, the update resolves a problem that can cause programs that use Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0, such as Microsoft Office Outlook with Business Contact Manager, to stop functioning as expected after applying the MS09-060 security update. Microsoft encourages customers who use Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0 to apply the update available from KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234, depending on your version of Microsoft Office, after installing the MS09-060 security update. Customers who do not use Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0 will not require the KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234 update.</p>
<p><strong>Why are KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 labeled as Security Updates, when they contain no security-related fixes?</strong><br/>
The KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 update resolves a known issue with the Outlook security update for MS09-060. Even though the KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 update does not correct any security-related issues, KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 are listed as Security Updates on Microsoft Update, Windows Update, Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) server, and by Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), due to patching requirements on certain platforms for updates resolving any post-installation issues with Outlook security updates that are necessary to make sure that the Outlook security updates work correctly. You do not have to install the known issue update if you do not install the Outlook security update. However, we recommend that customers install the MS09-060 security update if they plan to deploy Outlook in the future.</p>
<p><strong>I do not have Microsoft Outlook installed. Why am I being offered the known issue update for KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234?</strong><br/>
The known issue update for KB974554, KB974556, and KB974234 is being offered to most users of Microsoft Office, including users who do not have Outlook installed, because the MS09-060 security update affects a component that is used by most Microsoft Office products. It is not technically possible to reliably detect which of these users are using the Outlook View Control, so the known issue update for Outlook View Control is offered to all Microsoft Office users. Each user should determine whether the update is relevant to their environment based on their use of the Outlook View Control and Forms 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I get the Outlook View Control with Forms 2.0 known issue update for KB974554, KB974556, or KB974234?</strong><br/>

<h2 id="atl-uninitialized-object-vulnerability---cve-2009-0901">ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to force VariantClear to be called on a VARIANT that has not been correctly initialized. Because of this, the attacker can control what happens when VariantClear is called during handling of an error by supplying a corrupt stream. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. This issue could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2009-0901" data-linktype="external">CVE-2009-0901</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-atl-uninitialized-object-vulnerability---cve-2009-0901">Mitigating Factors for ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site.</li>

<h4 id="workarounds-for-atl-uninitialized-object-vulnerability---cve-2009-0901">Workarounds for ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901</h4>
<p>Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="faq-for-atl-uninitialized-object-vulnerability---cve-2009-0901">FAQ for ATL Uninitialized Object Vulnerability - CVE-2009-0901</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability only directly affects systems with vulnerable components and controls installed that were built using affected versions of Microsoft's ATL.</p>
<p>This is a remote code execution vulnerability. For example, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution if the user visits a specially crafted Web page with Internet Explorer that instantiates a vulnerable component or control. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is due to an issue in the ATL headers that could allow an attacker to call VariantClear() on a variant that has not been correctly initialized. For developers who created a component or control using ATL in this manner, the resulting component or control could allow remote code execution in the context of the logged on user.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
If a user has a vulnerable control on their system and an attacker bypasses the mitigations described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/973882" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory (973882)</a>, then an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer by attempting to exploit a vulnerable control, and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have to discover a vulnerable control, and force users to visit these Web sites. To do this, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the issue by ensuring VariantClear() can only be called on initialized variants, and provides updated versions of ATL that allow developers to address this issue in potentially vulnerable controls.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="atl-com-initialization-vulnerability---cve-2009-2493">ATL COM Initialization Vulnerability - CVE-2009-2493</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) due to issues in the ATL headers that handle instantiation of an object from data streams. This vulnerability only directly affects systems with components and controls installed that were built using Visual Studio ATL. For components and controls built using ATL, unsafe usage of OleLoadFromStream could allow the instantiation of arbitrary objects which can bypass related security policy, such as kill bits within Internet Explorer. This issue could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform remote code execution on an affected system. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution.</p>

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if users who should not have sufficient administrative permissions are given the ability to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by enforcing proper buffer allocation when reading a stream and providing updated versions of ATL that allow developers to address this issue in potentially vulnerable controls.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly disclosed when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. <strong>Note</strong> When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.

<p><strong>Note</strong> You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office 2003 CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then enter an update file name in <strong>Start Search</strong>.</li>
<li>When the file appears under <strong>Programs</strong>, right-click on the file name and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
<li>Under the <strong>General</strong> tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.</li>
<li>You may also click on the <strong>Details</strong> tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.</li>
<li>Finally, you may also click on the <strong>Previous Versions</strong> tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.</li>
