<PRE><A HREF="https://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.29.tar.gz">https://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.29.tar.gz</A>
<A HREF="https://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.29.tar.gz.sig">https://dovecot.org/releases/2.2/dovecot-2.2.29.tar.gz.sig</A> 

 * passdb/userdb dict: Don't double-expand %variables in keys. If dict
   was used as the authentication passdb, using specially crafted
   %variables in the username could be used to cause DoS (CVE-2017-2669)
 * When Dovecot encounters an internal error, it logs the real error and
   usually logs another line saying what function failed. Previously the
   second log line's error message was a rather uninformative &quot;Internal
   error occurred. Refer to server log for more information.&quot; Now the
   real error message is duplicated in this second log line.
 * lmtp: If a delivery has multiple recipients, run autoexpunging only
   for the last recipient. This avoids a problem where a long
   autoexpunge run causes LMTP client to timeout between the DATA
   replies, resulting in duplicate mail deliveries.
 * config: Don't stop the process due to idling. Otherwise the
   configuration is reloaded when the process restarts.
 * mail_log plugin: Differentiate autoexpunges from regular expunges
 * imapc: Use LOGOUT to cleanly disconnect from server.
 * lib-http: Internal status codes (&gt;9000) are no longer visible in logs
 * director: Log vhost count changes and HOST-UP/DOWN

 + quota: Add plugin { quota_max_mail_size } setting to limit the
   maximum individual mail size that can be saved.
 + imapc: Add imapc_features=delay-login. If set, connecting to the
   remote IMAP server isn't done until it's necessary.
 + imapc: Add imapc_connection_retry_count and
   imapc_connection_retry_interval settings.
 + imap, pop3, indexer-worker: Add (deinit) to process title before
   autoexpunging runs.
 + Added %{encrypt} and %{decrypt} variables
 + imap/pop3 proxy: Log proxy state in errors as human-readable string.
 + imap/pop3-login: All forward_* extra fields returned by passdb are
   sent to the next hop when proxying using ID/XCLIENT commands. On the
   receiving side these fields are imported and sent to auth process
   where they're accessible via %{passdb:forward_*}. This is done only
   if the sending IP address matches login_trusted_networks.
 + imap-login: If imap_id_retain=yes, send the IMAP ID string to
   auth process. %{client_id} expands to it in auth process. The ID
   string is also sent to the next hop when proxying.
 + passdb imap: Use ssl_client_ca_* settings for CA validation.
 - fts-tika: Fixed crash when parsing attachment without
   Content-Disposition header. Broken by 2.2.28.
 - trash plugin was broken in 2.2.28
 - auth: When passdb/userdb lookups were done via auth-workers, too much
   data was added to auth cache. This could have resulted in wrong
   replies when using multiple passdbs/userdbs.
 - auth: passdb { skip &amp; mechanisms } were ignored for the first passdb
 - oauth2: Various fixes, including fixes to crashes
 - dsync: Large Sieve scripts (or other large metadata) weren't always
   synced.
 - Index rebuild (e.g. doveadm force-resync) set all mails as \Recent
 - imap-hibernate: %{userdb:*} wasn't expanded in mail_log_prefix
 - doveadm: Exit codes weren't preserved when proxying commands via
   doveadm-server. Almost all errors used exit code 75 (tempfail).
 - ACLs weren't applied to not-yet-existing autocreated mailboxes.
 - Fixed a potential crash when parsing a broken message header.
 - cassandra: Fallback consistency settings weren't working correctly.
 - doveadm director status &lt;user&gt;: &quot;Initial config&quot; was always empty
 - imapc: Various reconnection fixes.
