<h2 id="cumulative-security-update-for-internet-explorer-912812">Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (912812)</h2>
<p>Published: April 11, 2006</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.0</p>
<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>
<p><strong>Who should read this document:</strong> Customers who use Microsoft Windows</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Vulnerability:</strong> Remote Code Execution</p>
<p><strong>Maximum Severity Rating:</strong> Critical</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Customers should apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Security Update Replacement:</strong> This bulletin replaces several prior security updates. See the frequently asked questions (FAQ) section of this bulletin for the complete list.</p>
<p><strong>Caveats:</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912812" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912812</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when they install this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. For more information, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912812" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912812</a>.</p>
<p>This security update also replaces the cumulative update for Internet Explorer that was released for Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition family, and Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 for Itanium-based Systems on February 28, 2006. This update was discussed in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=59550" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory (912945): Non-Security Update for Internet Explorer</a>. For more information about this update, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a>.</p>
<p>Compatibility Patch – To help enterprise customers who need more time to prepare for the ActiveX update changes discussed in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/912945" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 912945</a> and included in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=62568" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS06-013</a>, Microsoft is releasing a Compatibility Patch on April 11, 2006. As soon as it is deployed, the Compatibility Patch will temporarily return Internet Explorer to the previous functionality for handling ActiveX controls. This Compatibility Patch will function until an Internet Explorer update is released as part of the June update cycle, at which time the changes to the way Internet Explorer handles ActiveX controls will be permanent. This compatibility patch may require an additional restart for systems it is deployed on. For more information, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917425" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 917425</a>.</p>

<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p><span></span>
<strong>Executive Summary:</strong></p>
<p>This update resolves several newly-discovered, publicly and privately reported vulnerabilities. Each vulnerability is documented in its own “Vulnerability Details” section of this bulletin.</p>
<p>If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the most severe of these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>We recommend that customers apply the update immediately.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured Internet Explorer settings that reduce the likelihood of a user or of an administrator downloading and running malicious Web content on a server. Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration reduces this risk by modifying many security-related settings. This includes the settings on the <strong>Security</strong> tab and the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box. Some of the important modifications include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security level for the Internet zone is set to <strong>High</strong>. This setting disables scripts, ActiveX controls, Microsoft Java Virtual Machine (MSJVM), and file downloads.</li>
<li>Automatic detection of intranet sites is disabled. This setting assigns all intranet Web sites and all Universal Naming Convention (UNC) paths that are not explicitly listed in the Local intranet zone to the Internet zone.</li>
<li>Install On Demand and non-Microsoft browser extensions are disabled. This setting prevents Web pages from automatically installing components and prevents non-Microsoft extensions from running.</li>
<li>Multimedia content is disabled. This setting prevents music, animations, and video clips from running.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vulnerability-details">Vulnerability Details</h2>
<p><span></span></p>
<h4 id="dhtml-method-call-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1359">DHTML Method Call Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1359:</h4>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer displays a Web page that contains certain unexpected method calls to HTML objects. As a result, system memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-dhtml-method-call-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1359">Mitigating Factors for DHTML Method Call Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1359:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.</p>
<p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability in the e-mail vector because reading e-mail messages in plain text is the default configuration for Outlook Express. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="workarounds-for-dhtml-method-call-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1359">Workarounds for DHTML Method Call Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1359:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality.

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When Internet Explorer displays a Web page that contains certain unexpected method calls to HTML objects, system memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p>Specifically, the public postings discuss a potential behavior in Internet Explorer in the way that HTML objects may handle an unexpected <strong>createTextRange()</strong> method call to an HTML object. A Web page that is specially crafted to exploit this vulnerability will cause Internet Explorer to fail. As a result of this, system memory may be corrupted in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What is the createTextRange() method?</strong><br/>
The <strong>createTextRange()</strong> method is a dynamic HTML (DHTML) method that is exposed by the DHTML Object Model. For more information about DHTML methods, visit the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533053.aspx" data-linktype="external">MSDN Library Web site</a>.</p>

<li><p>Type the following command at a command prompt to deny the ‘everyone’ group access to this file:</p>
<p><strong>cacls %windir%\system32\mshta.exe /d everyone</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> HTML Applications (.HTA files) will stop working.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>Scripting</strong> section, under <strong>Active Scripting</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>

<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="com-object-instantiation-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1186">COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1186:</h4>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Internet Explorer instantiates COM objects that are not intended to be instantiated in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially allow remote code execution if a user visited the malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-com-object-instantiation-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1186">Mitigating Factors for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1186:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Customers who have installed the security update included with Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=50690" data-linktype="external">MS05-052</a> or a later security bulletin for Internet Explorer are not at risk from attacks originating from the Internet zone.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX Controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.</p>
<p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</p>

<h4 id="workarounds-for-com-object-instantiation-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1186">Workarounds for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1186:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your Internet Explorer settings to prompt before running ActiveX controls. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK.</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to “High” to prompt before running ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to prompt before running ActiveX controls. You can do this by setting your browser security to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p>To raise the browsing security level in Microsoft Internet Explorer, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Internet Explorer <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click the <strong>Internet</strong> icon.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Security level for this zone</strong>, move the slider to <strong>High</strong>. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If no slider is visible, click <strong>Default Level</strong>, and then move the slider to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Setting the level to <strong>High</strong> may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to <strong>High</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality.

These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
<p><strong>Prevent COM objects from running in Internet Explorer</strong></p>
<p>You can disable attempts to instantiate a COM object in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong> If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.</p>
<p>For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Internet Explorer, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797</a>. Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent a COM object from being instantiated in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>For example, to set the kill bit for a CLSID in the Mdt2gddr.dll, file that is included in this security update, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\{1F7DD4F2-CAC3-11D0-A35B-00AA00BDCDFD}]
&quot;Compatibility Flags&quot;=dword:00000400</p>
<p>You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, visit the following Microsoft Web sites:</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> You must restart Internet Explorer for your changes to take effect.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround</strong>: There is no impact as long as the COM object is not intended to be used in Internet Explorer.</p>
<h4 id="faq-for-com-object-instantiation-memory-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2006-1186">FAQ for COM Object Instantiation Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1186:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
When Internet Explorer tries to instantiate certain COM objects as ActiveX Controls, the COM objects may corrupt the system state in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and visits a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>

When Internet Explorer handles double-byte characters in specially crafted URLs it may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.</p>
<p><strong>What are Double-Byte Character Sets?</strong><br/>
Double-Byte Character Sets (DBCS) are an expanded 8-bit character set where the smallest unit is a byte. Some characters in a DBCS have a single byte code value and some have a double byte code value. A DBCS can be thought of as the ANSI character set for some Asian versions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms776454.aspx" data-linktype="external">product documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if I am running a DBCS locale?</strong><br/>
DBCS can be thought of as the ANSI character set for some Asian versions of Microsoft Windows. Examples of languages that use DBCS are Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages.

<h4 id="script-execution-vulnerability---cve-2006-1190">Script Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1190:</h4>
<p>A vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer in the way it returns IOleClientSite information when an embedded object is dynamically created. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page with a dynamically created object. This object would need to make use of the IOleClientSite information returned to make a security related decision. This could potentially allow remote code execution or information disclosure if a user visited the malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-script-execution-vulnerability---cve-2006-1190">Mitigating Factors for Script Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1190:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.</p>
<p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed.

<h4 id="workarounds-for-script-execution-vulnerability---cve-2006-1190">Workarounds for Script Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1190:</h4>
<p>Microsoft has tested the following workarounds. While these workarounds will not correct the underlying vulnerability, they help block known attack vectors. When a workaround reduces functionality, it is identified in the following section.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You can help protect against this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running ActiveX Controls or to disable ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Internet Options</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Internet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Local intranet</strong>, and then click <strong>Custom Level</strong>.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Settings</strong>, in the <strong>ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong> section, under <strong>Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins</strong>, click <strong>Prompt</strong> or <strong>Disable</strong>, and then click <strong>OK.</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Disabling ActiveX Controls in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Workaround:</strong> There are side effects to prompting before running ActiveX Controls. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX Controls. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>

<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-script-execution-vulnerability---cve-2006-1190">FAQ for Script Execution Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1190:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
A vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could potentially allow remote code execution or information disclosure. An attacker who successfully exploited this could at worst remotely take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer may return erroneous IOleClientSite information when an embedded object is dynamically created. This could allow this object to use the IOleClientSite information returned to make an incorrect security related decision and run in the context of the wrong site or the wrong Internet Explorer security zone.</p>
<p><strong>What is IOleClientSite?</strong><br/>
The IOleClientSite interface is the primary means by which an embedded object obtains information about the location and extent of its display site, its moniker, its user interface, and other resources provided by its container. For more information, see the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms693706" data-linktype="external">product documentation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What are Internet Explorer security zones?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360" data-linktype="external">security zones</a> are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones, based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is put in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by modifying Internet Explorer so that it returns the correct IOleClientSite information.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h4 id="cross-domain-information-disclosure-vulnerability---cve-2006-1191">Cross-Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1191:</h4>
<p>An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer because of the way that it handles navigation methods. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially lead to information disclosure if a user visited a malicious Web site or viewed a specially crafted e-mail message. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read cookies or other data from another Internet Explorer domain. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>

Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click <strong>Yes</strong> to run ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in &quot;Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone”.</p>
<p><strong>Add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone.</strong></p>
<p>After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to Internet Explorer's Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.</p>
<p>To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Internet Explorer, click <strong>Tools</strong>, click <strong>Internet Options</strong>, and then click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings</strong> box, click <strong>Trusted Sites</strong>, and then click <strong>Sites</strong>.</li>
<li>If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the <strong>Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone</strong> check box.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Add this Web site to the zone</strong> box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your computer. Two in particular that you may want to add are &quot;*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com&quot; and “*.update.microsoft.com” (without the quotation marks). These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.</p>
<h4 id="faq-for-cross-domain-information-disclosure-vulnerability---cve-2006-1191">FAQ for Cross-Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1191:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a malicious Web page that could potentially lead to information disclosure or spoofing if a user visited a malicious Web site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read cookies or other data from another Internet Explorer domain. However, user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer allows script to run in a browser window after a navigation to another site has been performed.</p>
<p><strong>What are Internet Explorer security zones?</strong><br/>
Internet Explorer <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q174360" data-linktype="external">security zones</a> are part of a system that divides online content into categories or zones, based on the trustworthiness of the content. Specific Web domains can be assigned to a zone, depending on how much trust is put in the content of each domain. The zone then restricts the capabilities of the Web content, based on the zone's policy. By default, most Internet domains are treated as part of the Internet zone. By default, the policy of the Internet zone prevents scripts and other active code from accessing resources on the local system.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read cookies or other data from another security zone or domain in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could host a malicious Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept user-provided content or advertisements, Web sites that host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain malicious content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by changing Internet Explorer so that it correctly identifies the domain from which the browser window originated.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through responsible disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h4 id="address-bar-spoofing-vulnerability---cve-2006-1192">Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1192:</h4>
<p>A spoofing vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker to display spoofed content in a browser window. The address bar and other parts of the trust UI has been navigated away from the attacker’s Web site but the content of the window still contains the attacker’s Web page.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-address-bar-spoofing-vulnerability---cve-2006-1192">Mitigating Factors for Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1192:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a malicious Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's Web site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Interacting with the Web page, for instance, by clicking on it, will cause the content to refresh and display the Web site identified by the address bar.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing Active Scripting from being used when reading HTML e-mail messages. However, if a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.</p>
<p>By default, Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2002, and Outlook 2003 open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. Additionally Outlook 2000 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33334" data-linktype="external">Outlook E-mail Security Update</a> has been installed. Outlook Express 5.5 Service Pack 2 opens HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone if Microsoft Security Bulletin <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=19527" data-linktype="external">MS04-018</a> has been installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537183.aspx" data-linktype="external">Enhanced Security Configuration</a>. This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section or this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-address-bar-spoofing-vulnerability---cve-2006-1192">FAQ for Address Bar Spoofing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-1192:</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a spoofing vulnerability in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow an attacker to display spoofed content in a browser window. Interacting with the Web page, for instance, by clicking on it, will cause the content to refresh and display the Web site pointed out by the address bar.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
It is possible to navigate the Internet Explorer address bar and other parts of the trust UI away from the attacker’s Web site but persist the content of the window.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a Web page that would display a URL of the attacker's choosing in the Address bar, while displaying a different Web site in the browser window. An attacker could use this vulnerability to create a malicious page that spoofs a legitimate site. However, it would not be possible to interact with this same Web site.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires a user to be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update removes the vulnerability by not allowing the window content to persist after navigation has occurred.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong> When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key.</p>
<p>Windows Server 2003, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003; Windows Server 2003, Web Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1; Windows Server 2003 R2, Web Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise Edition; Windows Small Business Server 2003 R2; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Datacenter Edition with SP1 for Itanium-based Systems; Windows Server 2003, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003, Datacenter x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Standard x64 Edition; Windows Server 2003 R2, Enterprise x64 Edition; and Windows Server 2003 R2, Datacenter x64 Edition:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows Server 2003\SP2\KB912812\Filelist</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 912812 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
<h4 id="windows-xp-service-pack-2-all-versions-and-windows-xp-professional-x64">Windows XP Service Pack 2 (all versions) and Windows XP Professional x64</h4>
<p>This security update requires Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2. For more information, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 322389</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> For Windows XP Professional x64, this security update is the same as the Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition security update.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong> When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry keys.</p>
<p>Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2, Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2, Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005, and Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP\SP3\KB912812\Filelist</p>
<p>Windows XP Professional x64 Edition:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Windows XP Version 2003\SP2\KB912812\Filelist</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly if an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 912812 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
<h4 id="internet-explorer-6-service-pack-1-for-windows-xp-service-pack-1-all-versions-and-windows-2000-all-versions">Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 for Windows XP Service Pack 1 (all versions) and Windows 2000 (all versions)</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
To install the Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 (SP1) version of this update, you must be running Internet Explorer 6 SP1 (version 6.00.2800.1106) on one of the following versions of Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows 2000 Service Pack 4</li>
<li>Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1</li>
</ul>
<p>The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong> When you install these security updates, the installer checks to see if one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.
If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the Update.exe installer, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951" data-linktype="external">Microsoft TechNet Web site</a>.</p>
<p>For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as <em>hotfix</em>, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your computer by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Registry Key Verification</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the following registry key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Updates\Internet Explorer 6\SP1\KB912812-IE6SP1-20060322.182418\Filelist</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This registry key may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, this registry key may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams the 912812 security update into the Windows installation source files.</p>
<h4 id="internet-explorer-501-service-pack-4-on-windows-2000-all-versions">Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 4 on Windows 2000 (all versions)</h4>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
For Windows 2000, this security update requires Service Pack 4 (SP4). For Small Business Server 2000, this security update requires Small Business Server 2000 Service Pack 1a (SP1a) or Small Business Server 2000 running with Windows 2000 Server Service Pack 4 (SP4).</p>
<p>The software that is listed has been tested to determine whether the versions are affected. Other versions either no longer include security update support or may not be affected. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle Web site</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) delivers a highly-configurable enterprise solution for managing updates. By using SMS, administrators can identify Windows-based systems that require security updates and can perform controlled deployment of these updates throughout the enterprise with minimal disruption to end users. For more information about how administrators can use SMS 2003 to deploy security updates, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=22939" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Security Patch Management Web site</a>. SMS 2.0 users can also use <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33340" data-linktype="external">Software Updates Service Feature Pack</a> to help deploy security updates. For information about SMS, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21158" data-linktype="external">SMS Web site</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> SMS uses the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer, the Microsoft Office Detection Tool, and the Enterprise Update Scanning Tool to provide broad support for security bulletin update detection and deployment. Some software updates may not be detected by these tools. Administrators can use the inventory capabilities of the SMS in these cases to target updates to specific systems. For more information about this procedure, visit the following <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33341" data-linktype="external">Web site</a>. Some security updates require administrative rights following a restart of the system. Administrators can use the Elevated Rights Deployment Tool (available in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33387" data-linktype="external">SMS 2003 Administration Feature Pack</a> and in the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21161" data-linktype="external">SMS 2.0 Administration Feature Pack</a>) to install these updates.</p>
