<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-office-graphics-filters-could-allow-for-remote-code-execution-968095">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Graphics Filters Could Allow for Remote Code Execution (968095)</h2>
<p>Published: December 14, 2010 | Updated: December 15, 2010</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves seven privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted image file using Microsoft Office. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Works 9, Microsoft Office Converter Pack, and supported editions of Microsoft Office XP and Microsoft Office 2003. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office parses certain image formats and validates data when rendering images. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968095" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 968095</a> documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Do I need to apply the MS10-087 update to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin (MS10-105)?</strong><br/>
Customers using Microsoft Office XP and Microsoft Office 2003 also need to install the Microsoft Office update provided in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=203241" data-linktype="external">MS10-087</a>, Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2423930), to be protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin (MS10-105). Both MS10-087 and MS10-105 updates need to be installed, but customers do not need to install the updates in any particular order.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
Refer to the reference tables in the <strong>Security Update Deployment</strong> section for the location of the file information details.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any non-security related changes to functionality?</strong><br/>
Yes. This update includes non-security changes that provide support for overriding the list of converters and filters that are blocked by default in Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010. For more information about security settings for Microsoft Office graphic filters, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2479871" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2479871</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?</strong><br/>
This update includes a defense-in-depth update that expands the list of converters and filters that are blocked by default in Microsoft Office 2007 and Microsoft Office 2010.</p>
<p><strong>What is defense-in-depth?</strong><br/>
In information security, defense-in-depth refers to an approach in which multiple layers of defense are in place to help prevent attackers from compromising the security of a network or system.</p>
<p><strong>How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by the vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word, or Microsoft PowerPoint is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of the affected Microsoft Office Suite.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a> Web site.</p>
<p>It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555" data-linktype="external">Select a Product for Lifecycle Information</a>. For more information about service packs for these software releases, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213" data-linktype="external">Lifecycle Supported Service Packs</a>.</p>
<p>Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options.

<h2 id="cgm-image-converter-buffer-overrun-vulnerability---cve-2010-3945">CGM Image Converter Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3945</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office allocates buffer size when handling CGM image files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens an Office document containing a specially crafted CGM image. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-3945" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-3945</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-cgm-image-converter-buffer-overrun-vulnerability---cve-2010-3945">Mitigating Factors for CGM Image Converter Buffer Overrun Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3945</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.</li>

<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Office improperly validates data in TIFF image files.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Office document with an affected version of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office document to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office document that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office document.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the data validations within Microsoft Office when rendering TIFF images.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>

<h4 id="faq-for-flashpix-image-converter-buffer-overflow-vulnerability---cve-2010-3951">FAQ for FlashPix Image Converter Buffer Overflow Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3951</h4>
<p><strong>What is the scope of the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>What causes the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Office improperly parses data in FlashPix image files.</p>
<p><strong>What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?</strong><br/>
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p><strong>How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted Office document with an affected version of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted Office document to the user and by convincing the user to open the file.</p>
<p>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains an Office document that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office document.</p>
<p><strong>What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?</strong><br/>
This vulnerability requires that a user is logged on and reading e-mail messages, visiting Web sites, or opening files from a network share for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where e-mail messages are read, where Internet Explorer is used frequently, or where users have network share access, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability. Systems that are not typically used to visit Web sites, such as most server systems, are at a reduced risk.</p>
<p><strong>What does the update do?</strong><br/>
The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Office validates data when rendering FlashPix images.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?</strong><br/>
No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.</p>
<h2 id="flashpix-image-converter-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2010-3952">FlashPix Image Converter Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3952</h2>
<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office parses specially crafted FlashPix image files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens an Office document containing a specially crafted FlashPix image. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see <a href="http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2010-3952" data-linktype="external">CVE-2010-3952</a>.</p>
<h4 id="mitigating-factors-for-flashpix-image-converter-heap-corruption-vulnerability---cve-2010-3952">Mitigating Factors for FlashPix Image Converter Heap Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3952</h4>
<p>Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</li>
<li>By default, the FlashPix image converter is not installed by Microsoft Office. Only systems where the FlashPix image converter is manually installed are affected by the vulnerability.</li>
<li>The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.</li>
<li>In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker’s Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Office file.</li>

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the 2.0 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.  
**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 3.1 or later be installed on the system.
  
To install the 3.1 or later version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable for Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=5a58b56f-60b6-4412-95b9-54d056d6f9f4&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable for Windows Server 2003, Windows XP, and Microsoft Windows 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch                    | Description                                                                                                         |  
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/?** or **/help**       | Displays usage dialog.                                                                                              |  
| **/passive**              | Specifies passive mode. Requires no user interaction; users see basic progress dialogs but cannot cancel.           |  
| **/quiet**                | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/norestart**            | Suppresses restarting the system if the update requires a restart.                                                  |  
| **/forcerestart**         | Automatically restarts the system after applying the update, regardless of whether the update requires the restart. |  
| **/extract**              | Extracts the files without installing them. You are prompted for a target folder.                                   |  
| **/extract:&lt;path&gt;** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/lang:&lt;LCID&gt;**    | Forces the use of a specific language, when the update package supports that language.                              |  
| **/log:&lt;log file&gt;** | Enables logging, by both Vnox and Installer, during the update installation.                                        |

For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.  
    2.  When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.  
    3.  On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    4.  You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.  
    5.  Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
