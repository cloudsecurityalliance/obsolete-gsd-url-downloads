<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-word-could-allow-remote-code-execution-951207">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word Could Allow Remote Code Execution (951207)</h2>
<p>Published: May 13, 2008 | Updated: May 14, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.1</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves several privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Word that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Word file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Critical for supported editions of Microsoft Word 2000 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 and rated Important for supported editions of Microsoft Word 2002; Microsoft Word 2003; Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 and Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 Service Pack 3; Microsoft Word 2007; Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats; and Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac and Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>This security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Microsoft Word handles specially crafted Word files. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This update includes additional security mitigations against public attacks using Microsoft Word to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Jet Database Engine first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/950627" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 950627</a>. In addition to installing this update, we recommend that customers install the update provided in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=114750" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-028: Vulnerability in Microsoft Jet Database Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution (950749)</a> for the most up to date protection against these types of attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>. Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> None</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why is this update rated Critical for Outlook 2007?</strong><br/>
The update for Outlook 2007 is rated Critical because of the e-mail attack vector described in the FAQ section of the Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091 in this bulletin. Outlook 2007 users should apply the update immediately to protect against attacks that attempt to leverage the preview pane to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>The Office component discussed in this article is part of the Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?</strong><br/>
Yes, if the version of the Office Suite installed on your system shipped with the component discussed in this bulletin, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that shipped with the particular Office Suite and offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is included in the version of the Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. However, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system. For more information on this issue, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/830335" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 830335</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the file information details?</strong><br/>
The file information details can be found in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951207" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951207</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?</strong><br/>
Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the &quot;Vulnerability Details&quot; section of this bulletin, this update includes logic enhancements to security warnings that mitigate Word as an attack vector used to exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Jet Database Engine first described in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/950627" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Advisory 950627</a>. Prior to this update, Word was vulnerable to attacks when opening a specially crafted Word document containing a malicious Jet database file. After applying this update, Word will prompt a user for confirmation before running SQL commands or queries when opening Word documents. In addition to installing this update, we highly recommend that customers install the update provided in <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=114750" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-028: Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Jet Database Engine Could Allow Remote Code Execution (950749)</a> for the most up-to-date protection against these types of attacks.</p>
<p><strong>This is a Microsoft Word update. Why are Microsoft Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 referenced in the Affected Software table?</strong><br/>
The files that are updated to address the vulnerabilities documented in this bulletin are core files to Microsoft Word. For Microsoft Word 2007 and Microsoft Word 2007 Service Pack 1, some of these core files are shared with Microsoft Outlook 2007 and Microsoft Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1, and provide functionality, such as editing, to Outlook. Therefore, Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 need to be updated as well, and Word 2007 and Word 2007 Service Pack 1 and Outlook 2007 and Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 are serviced by the same package.</p>
<p>Users with only Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will still need to apply this Word update to their systems. Users with Outlook 2007 or Outlook 2007 Service Pack 1 that also have Word 2007 or Word 2007 Service Pack 1 installed will also need to apply this update but they will only need to install it once. For more information on this issue, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949370" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949370</a>.</p>
<p><strong>I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?</strong><br/>
Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&amp;displaylang=en" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3</a>. We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this update rated Critical for Word 2000 but only rated Important for all other affected versions of Word?</strong><br/>
Users who are running Word 2002 and later have a built-in feature that will prompt a user to Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This mitigating factor reduces the vulnerability from Critical to Important because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.</p>

Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091  
--------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Office handles specially crafted Rich Text Format (.rtf) files. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted .rtf file with malformed strings in Word or previews a specially crafted .rtf file with malformed strings in rich text e-mail. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1091](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-1091).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   Users who have installed and are using the [Office Document Open Confirmation Tool for Office 2000](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=8b5762d2-077f-4031-9ee6-c9538e9f2a2f) will be prompted with **Open**, **Save**, or **Cancel** before opening a document. The features of the Office Document Open Confirmation Tool are incorporated in Office XP and later editions of Office.
  
#### Workarounds for Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality.
  
-   **Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to prevent the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents from unknown or untrusted sources and locations.**
  
    The following registry scripts can be used to set the File Block policy.
    
    **Note** Modifying the Registry incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from incorrect modification of the Registry can be solved. Modify the Registry at your own risk.
  
    **For Office 2003**
  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
    \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Word\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
    "RTFFiles"=dword:00000001
    
    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2003, all of the latest Office 2003 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.
  
    **Impact of Workaround**: Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open Office 2003 files or earlier versions in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.
  
    **How to undo the workaround:**
  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
    \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\11.0\\Word\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
    "RTFFiles"=dword:00000000
  
    **For Office 2007**
  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
    \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Word\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
    "RTFFiles"=dword:00000001
    
    **Note** In order to use 'FileOpenBlock' with Office 2007, all of the latest Office 2007 security updates as of May 2007 must be applied.
  
    **Impact of Workaround**: Users who have configured the File Block policy and have not configured a special “exempt directory” as discussed in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 922848](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922848) will be unable to open .rtf files in Office 2003 or 2007 Microsoft Office System.
  
    **How to undo the workaround:**
  
    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
  
    \[HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Office\\12.0\\Word\\Security\\FileOpenBlock\]
  
    "RTFFiles"=dword:00000000
  
-   Read e-mail messages in plain text format to protect against the e-mail attack vector.  
-   Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.
  
#### FAQ for Object Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1091
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

**What causes the vulnerability?**    
The vulnerability is caused by a memory calculation error when processing a malformed string in a specially crafted .rtf file. The error may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**    
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**    
This vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted .rtf file with an affected version of Microsoft Word.
  
In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted RTF e-mail to a system that uses Word as its default editor and previews the e-mail in either Rich Text Format or as HTML.
  
**Note** By default, Outlook 2003 does not use Word as its default editor. However, Outlook 2007 does.
  
In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a .rtf file that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's site.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**    
Systems where Microsoft Word and or Microsoft Outlook is used are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**Detection and Deployment Guidance**
  
Microsoft has provided detection and deployment guidance for this month’s security updates. This guidance will also help IT professionals understand how they can use various tools to help deploy the security update, such as Windows Update, Microsoft Update, Office Update, the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the Office Detection Tool, Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS), and the Extended Security Update Inventory Tool. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 910723](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910723).
  
**Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates as well as common security misconfigurations.

<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>After you install the update, you cannot remove it. To revert to an installation before the update was installed; you must remove the application, and then install it again from the original media.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance</strong>, earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Office, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>

|---------------------------------------------|-----------|  
| PIPC1, PROPLUS, PRO, SBE, STD, STDEDU, WORD | WORDFiles |
  
**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:

<p><strong>Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the “Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer” heading under the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance,</strong> earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
