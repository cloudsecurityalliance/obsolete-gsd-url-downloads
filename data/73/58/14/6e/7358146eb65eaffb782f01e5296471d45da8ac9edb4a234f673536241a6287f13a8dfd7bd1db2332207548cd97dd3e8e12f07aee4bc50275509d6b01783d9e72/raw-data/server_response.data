<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-office-web-components-could-allow-remote-code-execution-933103">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Web Components Could Allow Remote Code Execution (933103)</h2>
<p>Published: March 11, 2008 | Updated: May 14, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.3</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This critical update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office Web Components. These vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user viewed a specially crafted Web page. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This is a critical security update for implementations of Microsoft Office Web Components 2000 on supported editions of Microsoft Office 2000 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3, Visual Studio .NET 2002 Service Pack 1, Visual Studio .NET 2003 Service Pack 1, Microsoft BizTalk Server 2000 and Microsoft BizTalk Server 2002, Microsoft Commerce Server 2000, and Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2000 Service Pack 2. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>This security update addresses the security vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Office Web Components handles error conditions and manages memory resources, and by setting the kill bits for Microsoft Office Spreadsheet 2000 controls. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933103" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 933103</a> documents the currently known issues and recommended solutions that customers may experience when installing this security update. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>
<h4 id="affected-and-non-affected-software">Affected and Non-Affected Software</h4>
<p>The software listed here have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq-related-to-this-security-update">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update</h2>
<p><strong>Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?</strong><br/>
This update addresses several vulnerabilities because the modifications for these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.</p>
<p><strong>I do not have all of the Affected Software installed, but I do have other Microsoft Office applications installed. Why am I being offered the security update?</strong><br/>
The vulnerabilities described in this security update exist within Microsoft Office but could not be exploited using one of the applications listed in the Non-Affected Software table. The Microsoft Office applications listed in the Non-Affected table use some of the same files as the applications listed in the Affected Software that the security update affects. We recommend installing the update to prevent the security update from being offered again.</p>
<p><strong>I am using an older version of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?</strong><br/>
The affected software listed in this bulletin has been tested to determine which versions are affected. Other versions are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your product and version, visit <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Support Lifecycle</a>.</p>

Office Web Components URL Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4695  
---------------------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Office Web Components manages memory resources when parsing specially crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2006-4695](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2006-4695).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Office Web Components URL Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4695
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   By default, all supported releases of Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Outlook Express open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone helps reduce attacks that could try to exploit this vulnerability by preventing ActiveX controls from being used when reading HTML e-mail. However, if a user clicks on a link within an e-mail they could still be vulnerable to this issue through the Web-based attack scenario.  
-   By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See the FAQ section of this security bulletin for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
  
#### Workarounds for Office Web Components URL Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4695
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Prevent Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer**.
  
    You can prevent the Office Web Components Library from running in Internet Explorer by setting the kill bit for the control in the registry.
  
    **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use the Registry Editor at your own risk. For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or view the "Add and Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in Regedt32.exe.
    
    **Note** We recommend backing up the registry before you edit it.
  
    For detailed steps that you can use to prevent a control from running in Office Web Components, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797). Follow these steps in this article to create a Compatibility Flags value in the registry to prevent the Office Web Components library from running.
    
    **Note** The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the library objects are contained are documented in the FAQ “What does the update do?” Replace {XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX} below with the Class Identifiers found in this section.
  
    -   To set the kill bit for a CLSID with a value of {0002E510-0000-0000-C000-000000000046} and {0002E511-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

#### FAQ for Office Web Components URL Parsing Vulnerability - CVE-2006-4695
  
**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**   
This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**What causes the vulnerability?**  
An error in parsing a specially crafted execution command may corrupt system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code.
  
**What are Office Web Components?**  
Microsoft Office Web Components are a collection of Component Object Model (COM) controls for publishing spreadsheets, charts, and databases to the Web, and for viewing the published components on the Web.
  
**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**  
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**   
An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. This can also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.
  
**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**  
Workstations and terminal servers that have Microsoft Office Web Components installed are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.
  
**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**   
Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92039). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. See also [Managing Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=92055).
  
**What does the update do?**   
This update addresses the known security issue and sets the kill bit for a list of Class Identifiers (CLSIDs) for Office Web Components. To help protect customers, this update prevents these CLSIDs from being instantiated in Internet Explorer. For more information about kill bits, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797.
  
The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the COM objects are contained are as follows:
  
| Class Identifier                     | File                     |  
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|  
| 0002E510-0000-0000-C000-000000000046 | CLSID\_OWC9\_Spreadsheet |  
| 0002E511-0000-0000-C000-000000000046 |                          |
  
**What is a kill bit?**  
The kill bit is a method by which an ActiveX control can be prevented from ever being invoked via Internet Explorer, even if it's present on the system. (More information on the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797&id=kb;en-us;q240797)). Typically, when a security vulnerability involves an ActiveX control, the security update delivers a new control and sets the kill bit on the vulnerable control.

For more information about kill bits, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797&id=kb;en-us;q240797).
  
The Class Identifiers and corresponding files where the COM objects are contained are as follows:
  
| Class Identifier                     | File                            |  
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| 0002E533-0000-0000-C000-000000000046 | CLSID\_OWC9\_ DataSourceControl |  
| 0002E530-0000-0000-C000-000000000046 |                                 |
  
**What is a kill bit?**  
The kill bit is a method by which an ActiveX control can be prevented from ever being invoked via Internet Explorer, even if it's present on the system. (More information on the kill bit is available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base article 240797](http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q240797&id=kb;en-us;q240797)). Typically, when a security vulnerability involves an ActiveX control, the security update delivers a new control and sets the kill bit on the vulnerable control.

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the setup switches supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en) Redistributable  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338) Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337) Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch       | Description                                                                                                         |  
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/passive** | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**     | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**     | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path**  | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**       | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path**  | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**     | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**     | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**     | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**     | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**     | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951). For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
After you install the update, you cannot remove it. To revert to an installation before the update was installed; you must remove the application, and then install it again from the original media.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Office, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Note** Administrators working in managed environments can find complete resources for deploying Office updates in an organization at the Office Admin Update Center. At that site, scroll down and look under the **Update Resources** section for the software version you are updating. The [Windows Installer Documentation](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21685) also provides more information about the parameters supported by Windows Installer.
  
#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section. If you installed your application from a server location, the server administrator must instead update the server location with the administrative update and deploy that update to your system. For more information about Administrative Installation Points, refer to the **Office Administrative Installation Point** information in the **Detection and deployment Tools and Guidance** subsection.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33338)  
-   [Windows Installer 2.0 Redistributable for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Millennium Edition](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33337)
  
For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package Installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. **Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package Installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

#### Deployment Information
  
**Installing the Update**
  
You can install the update from the appropriate download link in the Affected and Non-Affected Software section.
  
This security update requires that Windows Installer 2.0 or later be installed on the system. All supported versions of Windows include Windows Installer 2.0 or a later version.
  
To install the latest version of Windows Installer, visit one of the following Microsoft Web sites:
  
-   [Windows Installer 3.1 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en)

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).
  
This security update supports the following setup switches.
  
| Switch      | Description                                                                                                         |  
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **/q**      | Specifies quiet mode, or suppresses prompts, when files are being extracted.                                        |  
| **/q:u**    | Specifies user-quiet mode, which presents some dialog boxes to the user.                                            |  
| **/q:a**    | Specifies administrator-quiet mode, which does not present any dialog boxes to the user.                            |  
| **/t:path** | Specifies the target folder for extracting files.                                                                   |  
| **/c**      | Extracts the files without installing them. If **/t:path** is not specified, you are prompted for a target folder.  |  
| **/c:path** | Overrides the install command that is defined by author. Specifies the path and name of the Setup.inf or .exe file. |  
| **/r:n**    | Never restarts the system after installation.                                                                       |  
| **/r:I**    | Prompts the user to restart the system if a restart is required, except when used with **/q:a**.                    |  
| **/r:a**    | Always restarts the system after installation.                                                                      |  
| **/r:s**    | Restarts the system after installation without prompting the user.                                                  |  
| **/n:v**    | No version checking - Install the program over any earlier version.                                                 |
  
**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package Installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841). For more information about the Package Installer, visit the [Microsoft TechNet Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=38951).
  
**Removing the Update**
  
To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.
  
**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**
  
-   **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**
  
    To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you can use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. MBSA allows administrators to scan local and remote systems for missing security updates and for common security misconfigurations. For more information about MBSA, visit the [Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer Web site](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21134).
  
-   **File Version Verification**
  
    Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.
  
    1.  Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.  
    2.  In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.  
    3.  In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.  
    4.  In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.  
        **Note** Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.  
    5.  On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.  
        **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
