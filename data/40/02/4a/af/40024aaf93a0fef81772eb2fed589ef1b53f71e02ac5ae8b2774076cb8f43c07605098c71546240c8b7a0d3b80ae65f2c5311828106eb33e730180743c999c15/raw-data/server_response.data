<h2 id="vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-visio-could-allow-remote-code-execution-949032">Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Visio Could Allow Remote Code Execution (949032)</h2>
<p>Published: April 08, 2008 | Updated: April 23, 2008</p>
<p><strong>Version:</strong> 1.5</p>
<h3 id="general-information">General Information</h3>
<h4 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h4>
<p>This security update resolves privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft Visio that could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted Visio file. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Visio 2002 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Visio 2003 Service Pack 2, Microsoft Visio 2003 Service Pack 3, Microsoft Visio 2007, and Microsoft Visio 2007 Service Pack 1. For more information, see the subsection, <strong>Affected and Non-Affected Software</strong>, in this section.</p>
<p>This security update addresses these vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft Visio performs validations when opening Visio files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, <strong>Vulnerability Information</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation.</strong> Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Known Issues.</strong> <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949032" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949032</a> documents the currently known issues and recommended solutions that customers may experience when installing this security update. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.</p>

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update  
----------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Why did Microsoft revise this bulletin on April 18, 2008?**   
This bulletin has been revised to correct detection and installation issues that had impacted users of Microsoft Office 2007 components. The update previously offered and installed the Visio 2007 update to users who did not have Visio 2007 installed on their systems. Microsoft has corrected the issue and updated this bulletin to reference the change. This change was a detection change only that does not affect the files contained in the initial update. Systems running Visio 2007 that have already applied the update will not be re-offered the update, and users who have already installed the update will not need to re-apply it to their systems.
  
**What is the security impact of this update having been installed if I do not have Visio 2007 installed on my system? What should I do?**   
None. Having incorrectly installed this update on a system that does not have Visio 2007 installed will not increase the security risk of that system. Users can uninstall the update if the update has already been applied. However, uninstalling the update is not required, as the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.
  
**I use Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2. Are any additional security features included in this update?**   
Yes, as part of the servicing model for Microsoft Office 2003, when users of Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 install this update, their systems will be upgraded to security functionality that was initially released with Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3. All updates released after January 1, 2008 for Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 2 will include these security features, which were introduced in [Microsoft Office 2003 Service Pack 3](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=e25b7049-3e13-433b-b9d2-5e3c1132f206&displaylang=en). We have thoroughly tested this update, but as with all updates, we recommend that users perform testing appropriate to the environment and configuration of their systems. For more information on this issue, please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 951646](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951646).
  
**Where are the file information details?**   
The file information details can be found in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 949032](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949032).
  
**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**   
The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. To determine the support life cycle for your software release, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).
  
It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. For more information about the Windows Product Lifecycle, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742). For more information about the extended security update support period for these software versions or editions, visit [Microsoft Product Support Services](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33328).
  
Customers who require custom support for older releases must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit [Microsoft Worldwide Information](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329), select the country, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Windows Operating System Product Support Lifecycle FAQ](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33330).

Visio Object Header Vulnerability CVE-2008-1089  
-----------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Visio validates object header data in specially crafted files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed file which could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.
  
If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1089](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-1089).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Visio Object Header Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1089
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
  
#### Workarounds for Visio Object Header Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1089
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   Use Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer or Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer to open and view Visio files. Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer and Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer are not affected by the issue.  
-   Do not open or save Visio files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

Visio Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1090  
-----------------------------------------------------
  
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Visio validates memory allocations when loading specially-crafted .DXF files from disk into memory. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a malformed file which could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.
  
If a user were logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.
  
To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2008-1090](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2008-1090).
  
#### Mitigating Factors for Visio Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1090
  
Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:
  
-   By default, AutoCAD drawing files (.DXF file extension) are not registered by Visio by default and would not open a specially crafted .DXF file by double clicking on it. An attacker would have to convince a user to open a .DXF file by opening Visio, selecting Open and then change the default file type from "All Visio Files" to "AutoCAD Drawing".  
-   In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.  
-   An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.  
-   The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
  
#### Workarounds for Visio Memory Validation Vulnerability - CVE-2008-1090
  
Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:
  
-   **Disable Visio from opening .DXF file by restricting access to DWGDP.DLL.**  
    To restrict access to DWGDP.DLL, type the following at the command prompt:    
    **Note** For Vista, an account with administrator privileges is required to implement this workaround.  
    **For Windows XP**  
    Echo y|cacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /D everyone  
    **For Windows Vista**  
    Takeown.exe /f "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll"  
    Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /save %TEMP%\\DWGDP\_ACL.TXT  
    Icacls.exe "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /deny everyone:(F)  
    **Impact of Workaround:** The impact of implementing this workaround is that Visio will no longer open AutoCAD drawing files (.DXF). If you have no need to open AutoCAD drawing files, this workaround should have no impact to your system’s functionality.  
    **How to Undo the Workaround**: To rollback this workaround, type the following at the command prompt:  
    **For Windows XP**  
    cacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /G everyone  
    **For Windows** **Vista**  
    Icacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /grant everyone:(F)  
    Icacls "%ProgramFiles%\\microsoft office\\visio11\\dll\\dwgdp.dll" /restore %TEMP%\\DWGDP\_ACL.TXT  
-   **Use Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer or Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer to open and view Visio files.** Microsoft Visio 2003 Viewer and Microsoft Visio 2007 Viewer are not affected by the issue.  
-   **Do not open or save Microsoft Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources.** This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

<p><strong>Note</strong> You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Removing the Update</strong></p>
<p>To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. <strong>Note</strong> When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the Microsoft Office XP CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771" data-linktype="external">Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer</strong></p>
<p>To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the “Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer” heading under the section, <strong>Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance,</strong> earlier in this bulletin for more information.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>File Version Verification</strong></p>
<p>Because there are several versions and editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Search Results</strong> pane, click <strong>All files and folders</strong> under <strong>Search Companion</strong>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>All or part of the file name</strong> box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Depending on the version of the operating system or programs installed, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Version</strong> tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.<br/>
<strong>Note</strong> Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.</li>
